Biden also told Arizona voters to ""elect me, I am in the 20th century"" during a discussion on abortion.",undetermined,"1. Political Instability: The article suggests that President Joe Biden may have made a mistake while reading from a teleprompter, which could contribute to concerns about his mental acuity and potentially create uncertainty around his ability to lead the country. This political instability could have a negative impact on the stock market, including Paramount stocks, as investors may be less likely to invest in uncertain conditions.
2. Negative Publicity: The article also highlights some negative publicity for the Biden administration, including criticism from a world leader and a series of verbal slip-ups. Negative publicity can impact consumer confidence and affect the overall economy, which in turn could impact Paramount stocks.
3. Market Volatility: Political events and negative publicity can contribute to market volatility, which can have a direct impact on Paramount stocks. When there is uncertainty in the market, investors may be more likely to sell off their stocks, leading to a decrease in stock prices. Conversely, if the market perceives the situation as temporary and not indicative of larger issues, it could bounce back quickly. However, any market volatility can impact Paramount stocks in the short term."

Among the instances it details:\n\na Jewish man being attacked outside a Chicago screening of a documentary about the Hamas attack on the Nova music festival in southern Israel on October 7\n\nthe film director Jonathan Glazer making claims that Israel's prosecution of the Israel-Hamas war is \""dehumanization\""\n\nfake accounts on X, formerly known as Twitter, pushing the phrase \""Zionism=Nazism\""\n\na forum hosted by the U.S. House Education and Workforce Committee at which Jewish students shared first hand accounts of being threatened on college campuses\n\n\n\nStories like these and many others have Jewish leaders increasingly alarmed as the holiday of Passover gets underway.\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League issued a report earlier this year that included nearly 3,300 anti-Semitic instances in the final three months of last year, including 56 physical assaults, 554 incidents of vandalism, 1,347 examples of verbal or written harassment, and 1,307 rallies on colleges campuses that involved anti-Semitic rhetoric \u2014 including ones that involved support for terrorism.\n\nPerhaps most acute on this first day of the Jewish holiday is the ongoing situation on college campuses. Columbia University 3rd year student Eden Yadegar is from Los Angeles and president of the group Students Supporting Israel. Because of her leadership role, she's witnessed and heard from other students about scores of instances.\n\n\""Saturday night was horrible,\"" she says, describing, how a couple of Jewish students on campus holding an Israeli flag had it ripped from their hands and set on fire. \""Someone threw fake blood at my friends on campus,\"" Yadegar says.\n\nOther instances have included protesters yelling \""Go back to Poland!\"" according to Yadegar. She says the frequency has escalated in the days leading up to Passover, especially calls for violence.\n\nThat increasingly heated language as well as instances of actual violence have American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch alarmed.\n\n\""When protestors take to city streets and college quads to sing the praises of Hamas,\"" Deutch says, \""and when they applaud Iran launching missiles at Israel, we should be appalled.\""\n\nDeutch says this issue of extremist rhetoric is not only of concern for the Jewish community but for everyone. And he argues speech that celebrates terrorism and terrorist groups like Hamas is not protected political speech but rather hate speech specifically directed at Jews.\n\n\""It's not serious political speech,\"" he says. \""It's antisemitism.\""\n\nHe says this Passover, he's particularly disturbed by the fact that Hamas is still holding 130 hostages in Gaza. Deutch says that situation makes the scene in the biblical book of Exodus where Moses tells Pharaoh to \""let my people go\"" especially poignant.\n\nA rise in religion-based bias\n\nA report titled \""The State of Antisemitism in America\"" published by the American Jewish Committee in February found that 94% of Jews and 74% of all U.S. adults say antisemitism is a very serious or somewhat serious problem.\n\nThe national survey also found that American Jews are uncertain about their place in American society. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said that the status of Jews in the U.S. is less secure than one year ago, up dramatically over recent years.\n\nFBI data released in October 2023, covering crimes reported in 2022, shows that about 55% of all religion-based hate crimes were driven by anti-Jewish bias. About 8% involved anti-Muslim bias. No FBI data is available yet on more recent instances.\n\nJews are not alone in experiencing religion-based instances of intimidation. The Council on American-Islamic Relations' annual Civil Rights Report says that last year it received the highest number of anti-Muslim bias complaints ever. CAIR says it took in 8,061 bias reports in 2023 and that nearly half of them came in the final three months of the year, following the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nThe report found that 7.5% of complaints involved allegations of hate crimes, including the case of 6-year-old Palestinian American Wadea Al-Fayoume who was allegedly stabbed to death by his family's landlord and his mother wounded during an attack in an apartment near Chicago.\n\nProsecutors in that case charged suspect Joseph Czuba with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and two counts of hate crimes.\n\nWhat can be done to challenge anti-Jewish hate\n\n\""I've never been more frightened or disturbed,\"" says Robert Williams, executive director of the University of Southern California Shoah Foundation and the UNESCO Chair on Antisemitism and Holocaust Research.\n\nHe says the normalization of rhetoric calling for violence that he's seen and heard on college campuses and elsewhere needs careful attention. \""We need our political and cultural leaders to say enough is enough,\"" Williams says. \""These actions are not acceptable.\""\n\nCivil dialogue, he says, is what's needed and civil dialogue has been sorely lacking in the months since Oct. 7th. He understands that the very real concerns on the various sides of the Israel-Hamas War deserve to be aired out. But Williams says that needs to be done in ways that don't devolve into violence or calls for violence or the carrying out of actual violence.\n\nThe larger solution, he says, is not an immediate one because the best corrective against antisemitism is education, which is a long-term prospect. Williams points out that antisemitism didn't end in Germany immediately after the Allied victory in World War II but rather took decades of purposeful dialogue, lessons and political will.\n\nA portion of the people clearly intend to create harm, Williams believes, but he also says perhaps a significant number might not know that they're saying hurtful things.\n\nThe phrase 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' is a slogan often heard at pro-Palestinian rallies. What some might yell as a call for Palestinian liberation from occupation and freedom from violence, many Jews hear as a call for the annihilation of the state of Israel (situated between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea), which they see as an existential threat to Jews in general.\n\nWilliams sees a tendency for people outside of an experience to tell people what is and is not victimization. In recent years, people have grown used to the idea that women, people of color and LGBTQ people have the right to label language or actions sexist, racist or homophobic.\n\nBut Williams says sometimes, \""human rights discourse has been absent of discussions of anti-Jewish bias.\"" Doing so might help people see that rhetoric calling into question the existence of Israel or its right to defend itself is experienced as anti-Semitic although those saying it might be using the language in what they understand to be political terms.\n\n\""I hope the Jewish diaspora realizes,\"" says Williams, \""that there are allies at this moment and there is always an opportunity to turn the tide.\""\n\nThe heated anti-Semitic rhetoric around the country and the world, as Jews begin the observe Passover, is a real challenge, he says. But the holiday is an opportunity to reflect on Jewish strength, resistance and resilience over millennia.\n\n\""We're being put to a considerable test today,\"" Williams says, \""but there is always hope.\""\n\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

Potential for reputational damage: If the case is perceived negatively by the public or if AstraZeneca is seen as having any connection to the incident, the company's reputation could be tarnished. This could lead to negative consequences such as decreased investor confidence, which may ultimately impact the stock price."

Disruption of supply chain: The illegal fishing of baby eels (elvers) in Nova Scotia by individuals from Maine could potentially disrupt the supply of elvers to aquaculture operations in China and Japan. This disruption in the supply chain could affect the Paramount stocks if the company has any business interests in the elver fishing industry or if it relies on the smooth functioning of this supply chain for its operations.

2. Regulatory implications: The federal Fisheries Department's closure of the 2024 fishery and the arrest of 95 people for illegal fishing indicates stricter regulations and enforcement in the elver fishing industry. This could have implications for Paramount stocks if the company operates in this industry or has any investments related to it. Stricter regulations could lead to increased costs, reduced profits, or potential legal issues if the company is found to be in violation of any regulations.

3. Market volatility: The high prices of elvers in 2022 ($5,000 per kilogram) and the potential disruption of the supply chain due to illegal fishing activities could lead to increased market volatility in the elver fishing industry.

The EU already has an inquiry into Chinese government backing for electric-car manufacturers that could lead to new tariffs, and it\u2019s scrutinizing other industries like wind energy, solar and railways.\n\nEU relations with Beijing have been deteriorating over the past year and more, as Europe becomes more assertive in responding to China\u2019s trade policies. European leaders have pushed back against China\u2019s surge in manufacturing capacity, its massive trade surplus and its support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe probe is the first use of the bloc\u2019s so-called International Procurement Instrument, a 2022 law that\u2019s meant to promote reciprocity in access to public procurement markets.\n\nThe investigation was first reported by Bloomberg last week and will initially focus on information gathering from companies and member states before authorities start talks with Beijing on fair and open markets. The probe will need to be concluded within nine months.\n\nIf the EU finds a lack of reciprocity in procurement markets then it could restrict Chinese access to the bloc\u2019s tenders. Should a dialog with Beijing lead to tangible corrective actions, the probe can be suspended at any time.\n\nThe EU argues that Beijing has been pushing market-distorting measures and practices to implement its \u201cMade in China\u201d policy and its target of achieving 85% domestic market share for Chinese companies producing \u201ccore medical device components\u201d by 2025. The target is 70% for higher-end devices.\n\nThe bloc also claims the Chinese government discriminates against imported products and has, at times, imposed stringent requirements on foreign firms, including investment obligations or technology transfers to Chinese entities.\n\nBeijing\u2019s focus on local and state-oriented procurement in medical technologies has increased in recent years, as authorities across the country included strict domestic product requirements for many categories of devices. The shift turned a \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) trade deficit in these goods for China in 2019 into a \u20ac5.2 billion ($5.5 billion) surplus just one year later, according to data cited in an EU report published earlier this month.\n\nAnti-Subsidy Raid\n\nIn another move this week, EU watchdogs raided the European premises of a security equipment company Tuesday under new anti-subsidy laws. While the firm\u2019s nationality wasn\u2019t specified, China\u2019s chamber of commerce in the EU said it was \u201cshocked.\u201d\n\nNuctech, a state-owned company best known for manufacturing baggage inspection devices used in airports across the world, confirmed to Bloomberg that it was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the EU but declined to confirm if it was inspected.\n\nIn 2020, the US government European governments against the use of Nuctech\u2019s devices, accusing them of being a security risk.\n\nMarket Access\n\nThe EU\u2019s access to China\u2019s procurement market has long been a grievance, with the issue raised by both European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the bloc\u2019s trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis during trips to the country last year. Other issues include opaquely defined market-access terms, the transfer of industrial data out of China and invasive requirements imposed on cosmetic firms.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, our repeated discussions with China on this trade irritant have been fruitless,\u201d Dombrovskis said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cWe trust that this IPI investigation will galvanize our dialog and help us find mutually agreeable solutions.\u201d\n\nTalks over the past 12 months have seen little movement, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nChina\u2019s medical technology market was valued at \u20ac135 billion ($145 billion) in 2022, according to Merics, a research institute focusing on China. Major European manufacturers operating in the industry include Siemens and Philips.\n\nIn Beijing last week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that Europe will erect more trade defenses if Beijing doesn\u2019t heed the concerns about unfair competition, dumping and overcapacity. China argues that the US and Europe are using such critiques as an excuse for protectionist policies that shield their own less-competitive firms.\n\nAll these issues, along with Europe\u2019s calls for China to stop aiding Russia, are likely to be high on the agenda when Xi travels to Europe in early May. He\u2019s due to visit EU members France and Hungary, as well as Serbia.\n\nChina is one of Europe\u2019s biggest trading partners, but the top EU diplomat in charge of Asia relations was critical this week of the huge export surplus China runs with the bloc.\n\n\u201cChinese over-capacities and trade imbalances, they are a major factor of course influencing our relationship,\u201d Niclas Kvarnstrom, managing director for Asia at the European External Action Service, said in an interview. \u201cWe certainly think it requires action on their side.\u201d\n\nSpying Arrests\n\nOn top of the economic disagreements, the arrest this week of four people in Germany on accusations of spying for China will add to the tension. Three were detained Monday on suspicion of working for Chinese state security to acquire industrial secrets, while another person was arrested Tuesday in connection with spying on the European parliament and Chinese opposition figures.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry hit back at the spying arrests.\n\n\u201cI hope that relevant people in Germany will ditch the Cold War mentality and stop manipulating political narratives against China by raising this so-called spy risk,\u201d spokesman Wang Wenbin said Tuesday. \u201cWe firmly oppose this hyping up and also urge relevant sides to stop spreading misinformation.\u201d\n\nEurope last year launched an anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles made in China that could see new tariffs introduced by July. It reflects growing concern about Beijing\u2019s financial support for critical industries, which threatens to swamp would-be competitors in Europe, and a broader EU security strategy that seeks to toughen export controls and investment screenings.\n\nChinese leaders have pushed back against European and US criticism that Beijing has skewed China\u2019s market in favor of its companies.\n\n\u201cIndustrial subsidies are a common practice in the world,\u201d Chinese Premier Li Qiang said in his talks with Scholz last week, according to a German government transcript. \u201cMany countries have much more subsidies than China.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s approach aligns with a firmer US stance against China.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Chinese leaders during her visit last month that the country\u2019s ramped-up factory output has become a global problem. The US won\u2019t take \u201canything off the table,\u201d including the possibility of additional tariffs, to stem the flood of Chinese goods, she told CNN earlier this month.\n\n--With assistance from Sangmi Cha and Samuel Stolton.\n\n(Updates with detalls on separate raid of Chinese company starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.""","The European Union (EU) has launched an investigation into China's procurement of medical devices, suspecting unfair favoritism of domestic suppliers. This is the first use of the International Procurement Instrument, a 2022 law promoting reciprocity in access to public procurement markets. The probe will gather information from companies and member states, and could result in restricted Chinese access to EU tenders if reciprocity is not found. The EU is concerned about China's ""Made in China"" policy and alleged discriminatory practices against imported products. The investigation follows tensions over China's trade policies, manufacturing capacity, trade surplus, and support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The EU and China are also discussing market-access terms, industrial data transfer, and cosmetic firm requirements. China is one of Europe's biggest trading partners, but the EU has expressed concerns about the trade imbalance and overcapacity. This investigation is one of many actions raising tensions before President Xi Jinping's first visit to the EU in five years.",undetermined,"1.

3.

Decreased profitability: The news article mentions that Shell's profits have fallen by 46% compared to the previous year. This decrease in profits is likely to negatively impact the value of Shell stocks, as investors may be less inclined to invest in a company that is not generating as much revenue.

2. Increased debt: The article also states that Shell's debt has increased by 16% compared to the previous year. This increase in debt may make investors view the company as less financially stable, which could lead to a decrease in the value of Shell stocks.

3. Dividend cut: The article mentions that Shell has cut its dividend for the first time since World War II. This dividend cut could be a sign that the company is struggling to generate enough cash flow to support its current level of dividend payments. This could lead to a decrease in demand for Shell stocks, as investors may be less attracted to the company due to the reduced dividend."

(AP Photo/George Walker IV)\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2013 Protesters chanted \u201cBlood on your hands\u201d at Tennessee House Republicans on Tuesday after they passed a bill that would allow some teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns on public school grounds, and bar parents and other teachers from knowing who was armed.\n\nThe 68-28 vote in favor of the bill sent it to Republican Gov. Bill Lee for consideration. If he signs it into law, it would be the biggest expansion of gun access in the state since last year's deadly shooting at a private elementary school in Nashville.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nMembers of the public who oppose the bill harangued Republican lawmakers after the vote, leading House Speaker Cameron Sexton to order the galleries cleared.\n\nFour House Republicans and all Democrats opposed the bill, which the state Senate previously passed. The measure would bar disclosing which employees are carrying guns beyond school administrators and police, including to students' parents and even other teachers. A principal, school district and law enforcement agency would have to agree to let staff carry guns.\n\nThe proposal presents a starkly different response to The Covenant School shooting than Lee proposed last year. Republican legislators quickly cast aside his push to keep guns away from people deemed a danger to themselves or others.\n\nA veto by Lee appears unlikely, since it would be a first for him and lawmakers would only need a simple majority of each chamber's members to override it.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re creating a deterrent,\u201d the bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican state Rep. Ryan Williams, said before the vote. \u201cAcross our state, we have had challenges as it relates to shootings.\u201d\n\nRepublicans rejected a series of Democratic amendments, including parental consent requirements, notification when someone is armed, and the school district assuming civil liability for any injury, damage or death due to staff carrying guns.\n\n\u201cMy Republican colleagues continue to hold our state hostage, hold our state at gunpoint to appeal to their donors in the gun industry,\u201d Democratic state Rep. Justin Jones said. \""It is morally insane.\u201d\n\nIn the chaos after the vote, Democratic and Republican lawmakers accused each other of violating House rules, but only voted to reprimand Jones for recording on his phone. He was barred from speaking on the floor through Wednesday.\n\nIt's unclear if any school districts would take advantage if the bill becomes law. For example, a Metro Nashville Public Schools spokesperson, Sean Braisted, said the district believes \u201cit is best and safest for only approved active-duty law enforcement to carry weapons on campus.\u201d\n\nAbout half of the U.S. states in some form allow teachers or other employees with concealed carry permits to carry guns on school property, according to the Giffords Law Center, a gun control advocacy group. Iowa's governor signed a bill that the Legislature passed last week creating a professional permit for trained school employees to carry at schools that protects them from criminal or civil liability for use of reasonable force.\n\nIn Tennessee, a shooter indiscriminately opened fire in March 2023 at The Covenant School \u2014 a Christian school in Nashville \u2014 and killed three children and three adults before being killed by police.\n\nDespite subsequent coordinated campaigns urging significant gun control measures, lawmakers have largely refused. They dismissed gun control proposals by Democrats and even by Lee during regular annual sessions and a special session, even as parents of Covenant students shared accounts of the shooting and its lasting effects.\n\nUnder the bill passed Tuesday, a worker who wants to carry a handgun would need to have a handgun carry permit and written authorization from the school\u2019s principal and local law enforcement. They would also need to clear a background check and undergo 40 hours of handgun training. They couldn't carry guns at school events at stadiums, gymnasiums or auditoriums.\n\nTennessee passed a 2016 law allowing armed school workers in two rural counties, but it wasn't implemented, according to WPLN-FM.\n\nTennessee Republicans have regularly loosened gun laws, including a 2021 permit-less carry law for handguns backed by Lee.\n\nThe original law allowed residents 21 and older to carry handguns in public without a permit. Two years later, Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti struck a deal amid an ongoing lawsuit to extend eligibility to 18- to 20-year-olds.\n\nMeanwhile, shortly after the shooting last year, Tennessee Republicans passed a law bolstering protections against lawsuits involving gun and ammunition dealers, manufacturers and sellers. Lawmakers and the governor this year have signed off on allowing private schools with pre-kindergarten classes to have guns on campus. Private schools without pre-K already were allowed to decide whether to let people bring guns on their grounds.\n\nThey have advanced some narrow gun limitations. One awaiting the governor's signature would involuntarily commit certain criminal defendants for inpatient treatment and temporarily remove their gun rights if they are ruled incompetent for trial due to intellectual disability or mental illness. Another bill that still needs Senate approval would remove the gun rights of juveniles deemed delinquent due to certain offenses, ranging from aggravated assault to threats of mass violence, until the age of 25.""","Protesters chanted ""Blood on your hands"" at Tennessee House Republicans after they passed a bill allowing some teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns on public school grounds, and barred disclosing which employees are armed. The bill, which would not require parental consent or notification, is expected to become law and would be the biggest expansion of gun access in the state since last year's school shooting in Nashville. Democrats opposed the bill and accused Republicans of holding the state ""hostage"" to appeal to gun industry donors. It is unclear if any school districts will take advantage of the law, and gun control advocacy groups say about half of U.S. states allow teachers or employees with concealed carry permits to carry guns on school property.",undetermined,"1. Changes in gun laws can impact the demand for firearms: If the bill is signed into law, it could lead to an increase in the number of teachers and staff carrying concealed handguns in schools. This could potentially drive up demand for handguns, which could positively impact the stock price of firearm manufacturers like Paramount. However, if the bill is not signed into law, or if there is a decrease in demand for handguns due to other factors, it could negatively impact the stock price.
2. Changes in public sentiment and perception: The bill's passage could lead to public backlash or support, which could impact the perception of firearm manufacturers like Paramount. Negative public sentiment could lead to decreased demand for firearms, while positive sentiment could lead to increased demand. Additionally, any incidents involving firearms in schools could lead to increased scrutiny and negative publicity for firearm manufacturers.

Changes in regulations and legal liability: If the bill is signed into law, it could potentially lead to increased legal liability for schools and school districts that allow teachers and staff to carry concealed handguns. This could lead to increased insurance costs and legal fees, which could impact the financial performance of schools and school districts. Additionally, any changes in regulations or legal liability for firearm manufacturers could impact their financial performance and stock price."

The former president won 83% of the vote with about 98% of the ballots in.\n\n\n\nThe results come roughly seven weeks after Haley dropped out of the race and with independents prohibited from voting in the GOP primary, in a sign of weakness for Trump\u2019s third White House bid.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Biden faced a write-in campaign over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. While it is not clear how many write-in votes were part of the effort, over 50,000 votes were cast as write-ins, according to NBC News projections. When NBC News\u2019s write-in total is combined with the over 67,000 votes Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN) received, Biden possibly lost over 117,000 votes in the Democratic primary.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania remains one of the seven battleground states that will determine whether Trump or Biden returns to the White House. Both candidates have heavily stumped in the state.\n\nStill, the down-ballot races, including the Senate and a handful of House primaries, provided most of Tuesday\u2019s excitement as the results will set the stage for November, when control of the Senate and House will be up for grabs. Polls closed at 8 p.m.\n\nResults:\n\nPresidential\n\nBiden won Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday, with the Associated Press calling the race in his favor only two minutes after polls closed, at 8:02 p.m. Biden won 93.1% with 89% of ballots in. Phillips, who has suspended his campaign, secured 6.9%.\n\nThe \u201cUncommitted PA\u201d effort, whose website is paid for by the Democratic Socialists of America, was seeking to secure 40,000 votes, about half of Biden\u2019s victory in 2020, in Tuesday\u2019s primary. NBC News projected write-in votes garnered roughly 51,521 votes as of 11:53 p.m. on Tuesday night. Only registered Democrats could vote in the Democratic primary.\n\n\n\nIn the Republican primary, Trump defeated Haley, 83.5% to 16.5%, with 98% of the votes counted for, with the Associated Press calling the race at 8:09 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nSince exiting the race in early March, Haley has pulled roughly 10% to 20% of the vote in GOP state primaries against Trump. In Wisconsin, another critical battleground state, Haley won 12.8% of the votes compared to Trump\u2019s 79.2%.\n\n\n\nOnly registered Republicans could vote in the GOP primary.\n\nDelegates at stake: 67 Republican delegates, 159 Democratic delegates\n\nSenate\n\nIncumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA), who is seeking a fourth term, and Republican Dave McCormick won the Democratic and Republican primaries. Both candidates, who ran unopposed, are likely to use their expected primary wins to propel their campaigns ahead of their general election matchup.\n\nThe Associated Press called the races for both primaries at 8:01 p.m.\n\nThe 2024 race is McCormick\u2019s second time seeking a Senate seat in the Keystone State after losing the Republican primary race to Dr. Mehmet Oz during the 2022 midterm elections. Oz, who had the backing of Trump, then went on to lose in the general election to now-Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA).\n\nThe race between Casey and McCormick, who has the backing of Trump, is expected to be one of the most competitive of the 2024 cycle and could decide which party controls the Senate in November.\n\n1st Congressional District\n\nIncumbent Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) soundly defeated Mark Houck, 63.1% to 36.9%, with 78% of the votes counted after the Associated Press called the race at 8:13 p.m.\n\nFitzpatrick, the co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, is a centrist Republican who has served in Congress since 2017.\n\nHouck, an anti-abortion activist who is in favor of banning abortion with no exceptions for rape and incest, first came into the national spotlight in 2022 when he was federally charged for allegedly pushing a 72-year-old Planned Parenthood volunteer outside an abortion clinic in Philadelphia. Houck was later acquitted in the case in 2023.\n\nIn the Democratic primary, Ashley Ehasz, a former Army helicopter pilot, ran unopposed and will face Fitzpatrick in November. Fitzpatrick defeated Ehasz in 2022.\n\nFitzpatrick\u2019s seat is one of 16 districts that Biden carried in 2020 that was won by a Republican, making the district a pivotal seat both parties will be seeking in November.\n\n12th Congressional District\n\nIncumbent Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA) survived a primary challenge in Pennsylvania\u2019s 12th Congressional District from local Edgewood Borough Councilwoman Bhavini Patel, with the Associated Press calling the race for Lee at 9:21 p.m.\n\n\n\nLee secured 60.8% of the vote with 96% counted, while Patel won 39.2%.\n\nLee, a prominent member of the \u201cSquad\u201d who is seeking her second term in the House, has been a vocal critic of Israel and its response to the Oct. 7 attack on the country by Hamas. While Lee\u2019s seat is not expected to be competitive in November, Tuesday\u2019s primary offered one of the first tests of how lawmakers calling for a ceasefire in Gaza will fare in 2024.\n\nIn the GOP primary, businessman James Hayes ran unopposed and will face Lee in November.\n\n10th Congressional District\n\nFormer WGAL-TV anchor Janelle Stelson won the Democratic primary in Pennsylvania\u2019s 10th District, defeating five other Democrats for the opportunity to take on incumbent Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) in November.\n\n\n\nStelson won with 43.7% with 98% of the votes counted, with the Associated Press calling the race at 9:28 p.m.\n\nStelson defeated retired Marine Mike O\u2019Brien, former WITF-FM executive Blake Lynch, Harrisburg Councilwoman Shamaine Daniels, Army veteran and Carlisle school board member Rick Coplen, and businessman John Broadhurst.\n\nPerry, a former chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, has been a staunch ally of Trump and was an alleged participant in the effort to keep the former president in power in 2020.\n\n7th Congressional District\n\nState Rep. Ryan Mackenzie won the GOP primary race in Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th District against Republican rivals personal injury lawyer Maria Montero and business owner Kevin Dellicker, with the Associated Press calling the race for Mackenzie at 9:41 p.m.\n\nMackenzie secured 42% of the vote with 85% of the votes counted, while Montero won 24.9% and Dellicker won 33.1%.\n\nMackenzie will now face incumbent Rep. Susan Wild (D-PA), who ran unopposed for her seat in the Democratic primary, in November.\n\nAttorney general\n\nFive Democrats and two Republicans ran in the attorney general race to replace Democrat Michelle Henry, who was appointed by Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) in January when he stepped down as attorney general and was sworn in as governor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\n\nFormer Auditor General Eugene DePasquale won the Democratic primary, defeating four other Democrats and securing 36.9% of the vote with 90% of the votes counted, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMeanwhile, York County District Attorney Dave Sunday won his GOP primary race against state Rep. Craig Williams with 70.3% of the vote with 86% of the votes counted, according to the Associated Press. Williams won 29.7% of the vote.""","In Pennsylvania's primary elections, voters selected nominees for various races. In the presidential primaries, President Joe Biden won 93.1% of the Democratic votes, while former President Donald Trump won 83.5% of the Republican votes. However, both faced challenges: Trump received 17% of registered Republicans' votes for former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, and Biden faced a write-in campaign and possibly lost over 117,000 Democratic votes.

Down-ballot races, including the Senate and several House primaries, attracted attention, as their results will shape the November elections, determining control of the Senate and House. Incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Republican Dave McCormick won their respective primaries and will face each other in the general election.

In the 1st Congressional District, incumbent Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA) defeated Mark Houck, while Ashley Ehasz won the Democratic primary. Fitzpatrick's seat is one of 16 districts carried by Biden in 2020 and won by a Republican, making it a pivotal seat in November.

In the 12th Congressional District, incumbent Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA) survived a primary challenge, while businessman James Hayes won the GOP primary. In the 10th District, former WGAL-TV anchor Janelle Stelson won the Democratic primary and will face incumbent Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA) in November.

State Rep. Ryan Mackenzie won the GOP primary in Pennsylvania's 7th District and will face incumbent Rep. Susan Wild (D-PA) in November.

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments this week with profound legal and political consequences: whether former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution in a federal case charging him with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is hearing arguments this week with profound legal and political consequences: whether former President Donald Trump is immune from prosecution in a federal case charging him with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nIn addition to establishing a potentially historic ruling about the scope of presidential power, the court\u2019s decision \u2014 whenever it comes \u2014 will undoubtedly go a long way in determining a trial date for Trump in one of the four criminal prosecutions that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee faces.\n\nA quick decision in the Justice Department\u2019s favor could conceivably put the case on track for trial this fall. But if the court takes until late June to resolve the question, then the likelihood rises substantially that the November presidential election will happen without a jury ever being asked to decide whether Trump is criminally responsible for efforts to undo an election he lost in the weeks leading up to the violent Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nA look at what\u2019s ahead:\n\nWHAT IS THE COURT DECIDING?\n\nA straightforward but legally untested question: whether a former president is immune from federal prosecution for official acts.\n\nTrump is the first ex-president to face criminal charges, making his appeal the first time in the country\u2019s history that the Supreme Court has had occasion to weigh in on this issue.\n\nThough Justice Department policy prohibits the indictment of a sitting president, there\u2019s no bar against charging a former one. Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team says the Founding Fathers never intended for presidents to be above the law and that, in any event, the acts Trump is charged with \u2014 including participating in a scheme to enlist fake electors in battleground states won by President Joe Biden \u2014 aren\u2019t in any way part of a president\u2019s official duties.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers, by contrast, say former presidents are entitled to absolute immunity. They warn of a potential floodgate of prosecutions against former presidents if they\u2019re not entitled to immunity and say the office cannot function if the commander-in-chief has to be worried about criminal charges. And they cite a previous Supreme Court ruling that presidents are immune from civil liability for official acts, saying the same analysis should apply in a criminal context.\n\nHOW DID THIS ISSUE REACH THE COURT?\n\nThe Supreme Court will actually be the third set of judges to address the question in the last six months.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers last October asked U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, the trial judge overseeing the case, to dismiss the indictment on presidential immunity grounds.\n\nThe judge squarely rejected Trump\u2019s claims of absolute immunity, saying in December that the office of the presidency does not confer a \u201clifelong \u2018get-out-of-jail-free\u2019 pass.\u201d\n\nAn appeals court in February held the same, with a three-judge panel saying that for the purposes of this case, \u201cformer President Trump has become citizen Trump, with all of the defenses of any other criminal defendant.\u201d\n\nTrump appealed to the high court, which after several weeks, announced that it would consider \u201cwhether and if so to what extent does a former President enjoy presidential immunity from criminal prosecution for conduct alleged to involve official acts during his tenure in office.\u201d\n\nWHAT ARE THE COURT\u2019S OPTIONS?\n\nThe justices have multiple paths to decide the case. They\u2019ll probably meet in private a short time after arguments to take a preliminary vote on the outcome. Chief Justice John Roberts would be a prime candidate to take on the opinion for the court, assuming he is in the majority.\n\nThey could simply reject Trump\u2019s immunity claim outright, permitting the prosecution to move forward and returning the case to Chutkan to set a trial date.\n\nThey could also reverse the lower courts by declaring for the first time that former presidents may not be prosecuted for conduct related to official acts during their time in office. Such a decision would stop the prosecution in its tracks.\n\nThere are other options, too, including ruling that former presidents do retain some immunity for their official actions but that, wherever that line is drawn, Trump\u2019s actions fall way beyond it.\n\nYet another possibility is that the court sends the case back to Chutkan with an assignment to decide whether the actions Trump is alleged to have taken to stay in power constitute official acts.\n\nA court ruling in Trump's favor should have no bearing on the hush-money trial now underway in New York in part because that state-level case involves actions Trump took before he became president. And though Trump's lawyers have made the same immunity argument in a federal case in Florida charging him with hoarding classified documents, that case accuses Trump of illegally retaining the records and obstructing efforts to get them back after he left office \u2014 rather than during his presidency.\n\nHOW WILL THE RULING BEAR ON A TRIAL DATE?\n\nHow quickly the court moves after arguments could depend on how much agreement there is among the justices. Unanimous opinions almost always take less time to write than those that sharply divide the court.\n\nIf the justices rule against Trump and in favor of the government, the case would be returned to Chutkan, who would then be empowered to restart the clock on trial preparations and set a trial date.\n\nAny trial would still be several months away, in part because of Chutkan\u2019s decision last December to effectively freeze the case pending the outcome of Trump\u2019s appeal. She\u2019s also committed to giving prosecutors and defense lawyers time to get ready for trial if the case returns to her court.\n\nThat means that outstanding legal disputes that have been unresolved for months will again take center stage, not to mention new arguments and court fights that have yet to even surface but will also take up time on the calendar.\n\nThe trial is likely to take months, meaning it would likely threaten to run up against the election if it doesn\u2019t begin by August. Smith\u2019s team has said the government\u2019s case should take no longer than four to six weeks, but that doesn\u2019t include any defense Trump could put on. And jury selection alone could take weeks.\n\nWHY DOES TRUMP WANT TO DELAY THE TRIAL?\n\nThe timing of the trial \u2014 and whether Trump will be forced to sit in a Washington courtroom in the weeks leading up to the election \u2014 carries enormous political ramifications.\n\nIf Trump secures the GOP nomination and defeats Biden in November, he could potentially try to order a new attorney general to dismiss the federal cases against him or he could even seek a pardon for himself \u2014 though that is a legally untested proposition.\n\nSmith\u2019s team didn\u2019t mention the election in its filing urging the Supreme Court to reject Trump\u2019s effort to further delay the case. But prosecutors noted that the case has \u201cunique national importance,\u201d adding that \u201cdelay in the resolution of these charges threatens to frustrate the public interest in a speedy and fair verdict.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has accused Smith of trying to rush the case to trial for political reasons. Trump\u2019s lawyers told the Supreme Court in their filing that holding the trial \u201cat the height of election season will radically disrupt President Trump\u2019s ability to campaign against President Biden \u2014 which appears to be the whole point of the Special Counsel\u2019s persistent demands for expedition.\u201d""","The Supreme Court is considering whether former President Donald Trump has immunity from federal prosecution for official acts, in a case related to his alleged plot to overturn the 2020 election results. The court's decision will impact the trial date for Trump in this case, as well as three other criminal prosecutions he faces. Trump's lawyers argue for absolute immunity, while the Justice Department argues that former presidents are not above the law. The court will decide whether to reject Trump's immunity claim, declare that former presidents may not be prosecuted for official acts, or rule that Trump's actions fall beyond the scope of immunity. The ruling could have significant political implications, as a trial in the weeks leading up to the election could disrupt Trump's campaign.",undetermined,"1. Uncertainty of legal outcomes: The news article discusses a Supreme Court case involving former President Donald Trump, who is facing criminal charges for plotting to overturn the 2020 election results. The court's decision will impact the likelihood of a trial date for Trump in one of the four criminal prosecutions he faces. If the court takes a longer time to resolve the question, it may not be resolved before the November presidential election, which could lead to uncertainty in the stock market.

2. Potential impact on political landscape: The outcome of this case could have significant implications for the political landscape in the United States, potentially affecting the 2024 presidential election. If Trump is found criminally responsible for his actions, it could impact his chances of running for office again or receiving a pardon. This uncertainty could influence the stock market, as political stability is a factor in investor confidence.

3. Timing of the trial: The timing of the trial carries enormous political ramifications, as it could potentially disrupt Trump's ability to campaign if he secures the GOP nomination. The trial's proximity to the election could also impact the stock market, as investors may be hesitant to make significant financial decisions during a time of political uncertainty."

But there\u2019s rarely been a better description of the presumptive GOP nominee\u2019s entire approach to business and politics \u2013 or the way he\u2019s promised to behave if voters send him back to the White House.\n\nThe New York lawyer coined his phrase during a tense hearing on whether Trump violated the terms of the gag order in social media blasts, reposts and comments claiming the jury was full of biased liberals and targeting two potential key witnesses, his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen and adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAnd in remarks in an interview recorded before Tuesday\u2019s hearing but that was broadcast as Judge Juan Merchan considers whether to punish Trump, the ex-president was at it again. \u201cMichael Cohen is a convicted liar and he\u2019s got no credibility whatsoever,\u201d Trump said in an interview with WPVI Philadelphia.\n\nOnly six days into the trial, Trump is doing what he always does, pushing the rules and conventions of the law and accepted behavior to service his own narrative of victimization he\u2019s placed at the core of his 2024 campaign.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Viewer asks why judge can't increase Trump gag order fines. Legal expert weighs in 01:44 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump could face a ladder of escalating sanctions\n\nProsecutors now want Merchan to fine Trump $1,000 for each of 10 alleged violations of the gag order and to warn that imprisonment could be an option if he continues to flout restrictions. CNN\u2019s John Miller reported Tuesday that the Secret Service, court officers and the New York City Department of Corrections have quietly consulted on what to do if Trump ends up being jailed for contempt of court. That remedy remains a distant one for now, but any eventual step in that direction cannot be ruled out since no judge can allow a defendant to mock his authority in what is in essence a show of contempt for the rule of law.\n\n\u201cJudge Merchan has to have control of his courtroom,\u201d former judge and current Cooley Law School professor Jeffrey Swartz told Jim Sciutto on CNN Max. \u201cHe cannot allow someone who is under a gag order to basically say, \u2018I don\u2019t care what you think, judge, I am going to do what I want to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost inconceivable that any other criminal defendant would get away with lacerating the judge and his court in the way that Trump has done on his Truth Social network, in interviews and in his remarks to cameras outside the court. Trump claims the gag order stifles his right to free speech and to campaign as a presumptive party nominee. But that is blatantly false: the order is narrow \u2014 even if it was extended by the judge to cover his family following social media attacks by the former president on Merchan\u2019s daughter.\n\nOn Tuesday, Merchan grew visibly frustrated with Trump\u2019s lawyers when they insisted that their client was trying hard to comply with the order, without offering any evidence. At one point, in what quickly turned into a disastrous hearing for Trump\u2019s team, Merchan warned Trump\u2019s attorneys they were \u201closing all credibility with the court.\u201d Legal sketch artist Elizabeth Williams described the extraordinary moment when the judge clashed with Trump\u2019s counsel Todd Blanche. \u201cMerchan is a pretty cool character, he doesn\u2019t get easily riled up,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cThey were going at it.\u201d\n\nTrying, and failing, to hold Trump to account\n\nMerchan, like most judges, may not be used to such affronts. But he\u2019s the latest in a long line of judges, public officials, political aides and business associates \u2014 not to mention US laws and the Constitution \u2014 to try to constrain the former president. And while a dispute over one partial gag order might seem like a small wrinkle in an individual case, it conveys a wider truth about Trump\u2019s impact on American life.\n\nThere\u2019s a common theme in all Trump\u2019s four criminal cases, other legal quagmires and the single presidential term that produced two impeachments: He constantly refuses to comply with laws that apply to every other American.\n\nThe implicit underpinning of all Trump\u2019s pending trials \u2013 including two over his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, one over his hoarding of classified documents and other civil and fraud cases \u2013 is the same. It\u2019s that every American is equal in the eyes of the law \u2013 a principle that even applies to ex-presidents.\n\nBut Trump constantly infringes this bedrock value that is the pillar of the legal system. And he will do so in the most audacious of ways on the biggest stage later this week when the US Supreme Court hears his sweeping claim that ex-presidents are immune from prosecution for acts they committed in office. The argument is an attempt to derail special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s stalled federal election interference case against Trump. The former president posted on Truth Social on Sunday: \u201cWithout Presidential Immunity, a President will not be able to properly function, or make decisions.\u201d\n\nBut Trump is reaching for protections that would absolve the executive office of the presidency of legal accountability for criminal acts \u2014 a privilege that no other commander in chief in nearly two-and-a-half centuries has enjoyed and which appears to contradict the founding principles of a nation that rebelled against a monarch who was above the law. Most legal scholars believe there\u2019s no merit to his claims \u2014 a stance validated by a court of appeals ruling against Trump in Washington, DC. But any decision by the Supreme Court to suggest even some limited areas of presidential immunity could end up changing the scope of the office itself.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback George Conway on what struck him about Trump's gag order hearing 06:49 - Source: CNN\n\nTrump seems to consider he\u2019s above the law\n\nThis sense that Trump feels he\u2019s not covered by the same rules as everyone else shines through all of his legal cases \u2013 in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty \u2013 as well as his other escapades.\n\n\u2022 He\u2019s the first president in history to lose an election but insist that he won based on false and debunked claims of mass fraud.\n\n\u2022 He saw nothing wrong, as president, with phoning officials in Georgia and asking them to \u201cfind\u201d votes that did not exist so he could try to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s win in the critical swing state in 2020. The ex-president insisted the call was \u201cperfect\u201d \u2014 the same phrase he used to describe his attempt to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing an investigation into the Biden family in a conversation that led to his first impeachment.\n\n\u2022 The impulse to ignore gag orders and most accepted understandings of the limits of presidential power seems to spring from the same contempt for the rule of law that led Trump to allegedly mishandle troves of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and to claim they belonged to him and not the country. He\u2019s also awaiting trial in this case in which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty.\n\n\u2022 A sense that the law only applies to other people may have also informed the ex-president\u2019s overvaluing of his properties to secure preferential treatment from banks and insurance firms \u2014 an assumption countermanded by his loss in a near half-a-billion dollar civil fraud trial judgement against him, the Trump Organization and his adult sons earlier this year.\n\nWhile Trump\u2019s obliviousness to constraints horrifies his opponents, his willingness to tear down legal and political institutions is the key to his appeal to millions of supporters.\n\nIn his bid to win back the White House, Trump is appealing to Americans who distrust governing elites in politics, the law, the medical establishment and the media. He\u2019s posing as a champion who is enduring persecution so that they won\u2019t have to. \u201cI am your justice \u2026 and for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution,\u201d Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference in March 2023, reviving his bond with his populist base voters.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s willingness to trample the law and the principles of a democratic, constitutional system has severed his links with more traditional conservatives. George Conway, a conservative lawyer who before 2020 always voted for Republicans for president, will headline a fundraiser for Biden on Wednesday and will give nearly a million dollars to a joint fundraising committee to try to reelect him because he\u2019s worried about Trump\u2019s pledge to devote his possible second term to retribution. He warned Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t care a whit about the Constitution, about the rule of law. He wants to undermine the country and its rule of law for his own political purposes.\u201d\n\nConway, who was in court for the Trump trial on Tuesday, became emotional as he explained his decision to donate the maximum amount possible in an interview with CNN\u2019s Burnett.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s going to come out of my kids\u2019 inheritance, but the most important thing they can inherit is living in a constitutional democracy,\u201d Conway said.""","Prosecutor Chris Conroy described former President Donald Trump's behavior as ""he knows what he's not allowed to do, and he does it anyway"" during Trump's hush money trial.

This stability can positively impact Adyen stocks, as it reduces the perceived risk of investing in the country and can lead to increased economic activity.

2. Consumer confidence: The court's decision can boost consumer confidence, which can lead to increased spending and economic growth. As Adyen is a payment processing company, an increase in consumer spending can positively impact its revenue and, consequently, its stock price.

Angela Weiss/Pool Photo via AP\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Monday\u2019s opening statements in the first criminal trial of a former American president provided a clear roadmap of how prosecutors will try to make the case that Donald Trump broke the law, and how the defense plans to fight the charges on multiple fronts.\n\nLawyers presented dueling narratives as jurors got their first glimpse into the prosecution accusing Trump of falsifying business records as part of a scheme to squelch negative stories about him during his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nStill to come are weeks of what\u2019s likely to be dramatic and embarrassing testimony about the presumptive Republican presidential nominee\u2019s personal life as he simultaneously campaigns to return to the White House in November.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nHere\u2019s a look at some key takeaways from opening statements:\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying internal Trump Organization business records. But prosecutors made clear they do not want jurors to view this as a routine paper case. Prosecutor Matthew Colangelo repeatedly told jurors that that at the heart of the case is a scheme to \u201ccorrupt\u201d the 2016 election by silencing women who were about to come forward with embarrassing stories he feared would hurt his campaign.\n\n\u201cNo politician wants bad press,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cBut the evidence at trial will show that this was not spin or communications strategy. This was a planned, long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election, to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures to silence people who had something bad to say about his behavior.\u201d He added: \u201cIt was election fraud, pure and simple.\u201d\n\nThe business records charges stem from things like invoices and checks that were deemed legal expenses in Trump Organization records when prosecutors say they were really reimbursements to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels. Daniels was threatening to go public with claims she had an extramarital sexual encounter with Trump. He says it never happened.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nProsecutors\u2019 characterizations appear designed to combat suggestions by some pundits that the case \u2014 perhaps the only one that will go to trial before the November election \u2014 isn\u2019t as serious as the other three prosecutions he\u2019s facing. Those cases accuse Trump of trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden and illegally retaining classified documents after he left the White House.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, sought to downplay the accusations while leaving the courtroom on Monday, calling it all a \u201cbookkeeping\u201d case and \u201ca very minor thing.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s attorney used his opening statement to attack the case as baseless, saying the former president did nothing illegal.\n\nThe attorney, Todd Blanche, challenged prosecutors\u2019 claim that Trump agreed to pay Daniels to aid his campaign, saying Trump was trying to \u201cprotect his family, his reputation and his brand.\u201d\n\nBlanche indicated the defense will argue that after all the very point of a presidential campaign is to try to influence an election.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called democracy,\u201d Blanche told jurors. \u201cThey put something sinister on this idea, as if it\u2019s a crime. You\u2019ll learn it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nBlanche also portrayed the ledger entries at issue in the case as pro forma actions performed by a Trump Organization employee. Trump \u201chad nothing to do with\u201d the allegedly false business records, \u201cexcept that he signed the checks, in the White House, while he was running the country,\u201d Blanche said.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe 34 counts in the indictment are related to the payment to Daniels. But prosecutors plan to introduce evidence about a payoff to another woman \u2014 former Playboy model Karen McDougal \u2014 who claimed a sexual encounter with Trump, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about Trump having a child out of wedlock. Trump says they were all lies.\n\nProsecutors said they will show Trump was at the center of the scheme to silence the women, telling jurors they will hear him in his voice talking about the plan to pay McDougal. Cohen arranged for the publisher of the National Enquirer supermarket tabloid to pay McDougal $150,000 but not print the story in a practice known as \u201ccatch-and-kill.\u201d\n\nColangelo told jurors prosecutors will play for them a recording Cohen secretly made during a meeting with Trump weeks before the 2016 election. In the recording, which first became public in 2018, Trump is heard saying: \u201cWhat do we got to pay for this? One-fifty?\u201d\n\nTrump \u201cdesperately did not want this information about Karen McDougal to become public because he was worried about its effect on the election,\u201d Colangelo said.\n\nTrump\u2019s opening statement previewed what will be a key strategy of the defense: trying to discredit Cohen, a Trump loyalist turned critic and expected star witness for the prosecution. Cohen pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the hush money payments in 2018 and and served prison time.\n\nWhether jurors believe Cohen, who says he arranged the payments to the women at Trump\u2019s direction, could make or break the case for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer highlighted Cohen\u2019s criminal record, describing him as a serial liar who turned against Trump after he was not given a job in the administration after Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and found himself in legal trouble. Blanche said Cohen\u2019s \u201centire financial livelihood depends on President Trump\u2019s destruction,\u201d noting he hosts podcasts and has written books bashing his ex-boss.\n\n\u201cHe has a goal and an obsession with getting Trump,\u201d Blanche said. \u201cI submit to you that he cannot be trusted.\u201d\n\nAnticipating the defense attacks on Cohen, the prosecution promised to be upfront about the \u201cmistakes\u201d the former Trump attorney has made. But Colangelo said \u201cyou can credit Michael Cohen\u2019s testimony\u201d despite his past.\n\n\u201cI suspect the defense will go to great lengths to get you to reject his testimony precisely because it is so damning,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker is the first witness for prosecutors, who say that Trump\u2019s alleged scheme to conceal potentially damaging information from voters began with a 2015 Trump Tower meeting among the then-candidate, Pecker and Cohen. Pecker took the witness stand Monday before court broke for the day and his testimony is expected to continue Tuesday.\n\nAt the meeting, Pecker \u2014 a longtime Trump friend \u2014 agreed to aid Trump\u2019s campaign by running favorable pieces about him, smearing his opponents, scouting unflattering stories about him and flagging them to Cohen for \u201ccatch-and-kill\u201d deals. Those included the claims made by Daniels, McDougal and the former Trump Tower doorman, Dino Sajudin, prosecutors say. Trump says all were false.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nPecker will likely be asked about all the alleged efforts made by the Enquirer\u2019s then-owner, American Media Inc., on Trump\u2019s behalf. Federal prosecutors agreed in 2018 not to prosecute American Media in exchange for its cooperation in a campaign finance investigation that led to Cohen\u2019s guilty plea, and the Federal Election Commission fined the company $187,500, calling the McDougal deal a \u201cprohibited corporate in-kind contribution.\u201d\n\nPecker\u2019s brief turn on the stand Monday was mainly just about his background and other basic facts, though he did say the Enquirer practiced \u201ccheckbook journalism\u201d \u2014 paying for stories \u2014 and that he had the final say on any story about a famous person.\n\nThe prosecutor referred to Trump throughout his opening statement as \u201cthe defendant.\u201d His lawyer took a different tack, calling him \u201cPresident Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will call him President Trump, out of respect for the office that he held,\u201d Blanche said. At the same time, Trump\u2019s lawyer sought to portray him as an everyman, describing him as a husband, father and fellow New Yorker.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s, in some ways, larger than life. But he\u2019s also here in this courtroom, doing what any of us would do: defending himself,\u201d Blanche said.\n\nTrump sat quietly while listening to opening statements, occasionally passing notes to his lawyers and whispering in their ears. But outside of the courtroom, he continued his pattern of trying to capitalize politically on the case that will require him to spend his days in a courtroom rather than on the campaign trail.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\n\u201cThis is what they\u2019re trying to take me off the trail for. Checks being paid to a lawyer,\u201d Trump said.\n\nRicher reported from Washington.""","Former President Donald Trump is on trial for 34 counts of falsifying business records, related to hush money payments to silence negative stories during his 2016 presidential campaign.

For individuals, this would apply to profits above $250,000, but there is no lower threshold for corporations.\n\nThe medical association said many doctors will face higher taxes because they have incorporated their practices and used those companies to save for retirement.\n\nWhile the Liberals are aiming changes to the capital gains tax at younger Canadians including millennials and gen-Zers, Leger's poll found it had the support of 60 per cent of respondents over the age of 55 - the highest among any age group.\n\nPeople between 18 and 35 were least likely to support the Liberal plan to spend another $73 billion on defence in the next two decades. Just 45 per cent of respondents in that age group said ramping up defence spending is good for the country, compared with 70 per cent of people over the age of 55.\n\nLeger also asked questions about the country's fiscal future.\n\nAlmost half the respondents, 47 per cent, said they want to see the government cut back on spending and programs to get the budget balanced as quickly as possible.\n\nJust 16 per cent said spending more and running large deficits is the best plan for the next five years, and 14 per cent want to see the government increase taxes to bring the deficit down.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published April 24, 2024.""","The Liberals' latest budget has received a negative opinion from 45% of respondents in a Leger poll, with only 21% expressing a positive view.

Government spending on housing: The budget's plan to spend $8.5 billion on housing may impact the economy as a whole, which could indirectly affect the performance of various sectors, including pharmaceuticals. A strong economy tends to boost consumer confidence and spending power, which could have a positive effect on the industry. Conversely, a weak economy might lead to reduced spending on healthcare, including prescription drugs, negatively impacting the sector.

2. Changes to the capital gains tax inclusion rate: The proposed increase in the capital gains tax inclusion rate is expected to raise an additional $19.4 billion in revenue over the next four years. This change could affect the investment behavior of high-net-worth individuals, potentially influencing their decisions to invest in or divest from various sectors, including pharmaceuticals. If these changes lead to reduced investment in the sector, it could negatively impact the stock prices of companies like AstraZeneca.

3. Public opinion on government spending and fiscal policies: The poll suggests that Canadians are divided on the government's approach to fiscal policies, with 47% wanting to see the government cut back on spending and programs to balance the budget as quickly as possible. This sentiment could influence the government's future spending decisions, potentially affecting various sectors, including healthcare and pharmaceuticals. If the government decides to cut back on spending in these areas, it could negatively impact AstraZeneca's stock prices."

If we don't buy them someone else will, and that Michael Cohen would buy them or make sure they don't ever get published. That was my understanding from that meeting,\"" Pecker said.\n\nPecker reiterated that he did not plan to publish the Karen McDougal story -- despite its value to the National Enquirer if it were true -- in order to help the Trump campaign.\n\n\""That would kind of be like National Enquirer gold?\"" Steinglass asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker responded.\n\n\""Zero intention of publishing that story?\"" Steinglass asked.\n\n\""That is correct,\"" Pecker said.\n\nThe purpose of the arrangement, according to Pecker, was to help Trump win the election.\n\n\""You killed the story because it helped the candidate Donald Trump?\"" Steinglass asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\nApr 26, 1:11 PM\n\nProsecutors dispute that Trump arrangement was 'standard'\n\nOn redirect examination, prosecutor Joshua Steinglass sought to dismantle defense attorney Emil Bove's claim that former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker's actions on behalf of Donald Trump were nothing more than \""standard operating procedure\"" in the tabloid industry.\n\nSteinglass cited Pecker's previous testimony that nondisclosure agreements were commonplace in the course of his work.\n\nBut, Steinglass asked, \""On how many others did the CEO -- meaning you -- coordinate with a presidential candidate for the benefit of their campaign?\""\n\n\""That was the only one,\"" Pecker said.\n\nReferring to Michael Cohen's input on AMI's negotiation with Karen McDougal, Steinglass asked, \""Is it standard operating procedure ... to have a presidential candidate's campaign person weighing in on what terms of a contract are to be amended?\""\n\n\""No,\"" Pecker replied.\n\nSteinglass ticked through several other matters related to Pecker's arrangement with Trump, including whether it was common practice to offer a political candidate the opportunity to \""accept or reject\"" stories,\"" or for the paper to \""run attacks\"" on their opponents.\n\nEach time, Pecker answered \""No\"" -- that they were not common practice.\n\nApr 26, 12:52 PM\n\nPecker testifies that Cohen was prone to exaggeration\n\nFacing questions from Trump's attorney, former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker conceded that Michael Cohen was prone to exaggeration.\n\n\""Based on your experiences, Michael Cohen was prone to exaggeration?\"" Trump attorney Emil Bove asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker agreed.\n\n\""Could not trust everything he said?\"" Bove asked, before an objection from prosecutors interrupted that line of questioning.\n\nEarlier, Bove continued to try to highlight inconsistencies regarding the financial component of the \""catch and kill\"" arrangement discussed at the 2015 Trump Tower meeting.\n\nAt one point, Bove pointed to statements Pecker's attorneys previously made to federal prosecutors over information about the meeting that was included in Pecker's non-prosecution agreement.\n\n\""Your attorneys said to the DA that 'part of paragraph 3 was both wrong and inaccurate' -- do you remember that?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""No,\"" Pecker said.\n\nAs the sometimes-heated cross-examination wrapped up, Pecker remained firm in his testimony.\n\n\""I've been truthful to the best of my recollection,\"" he said.\n\nApr 26, 12:07 PM\n\nDefense suggests AMI's cooperation was financially motivated\n\nWhen the National Enquirer's parent company AMI signed a non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in New York in September 2018, AMI was negotiating to sell the Enquirer and two other tabloids to Hudson News Group for $100 million, former publisher David Pecker testified under cross-examination.\n\nDefense attorney Emil Bove suggested the pending sale put Pecker under pressure to resolve a federal campaign finance investigation over its payment to quash stories damaging to Donald Trump's presidential ambitions.\n\n\""You knew to finalize that deal, to consummate it, you had to clear out the investigations?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker responded. \""From a timing standpoint it would have added stress to the transaction.\""\n\nOn Thursday Pecker testified he had been \""very worried\"" about the investigation.

Jeff Sessions is the Attorney General and Donald Trump has him in his pocket.\""\n\nThe defense appears to be suggesting AMI cooperated with federal campaign finance investigations not because the company had done anything wrong related to the 2016 Trump campaign, but out of financial considerations in order to preserve the $100 million deal with Hudson News, which was finalized in April 2019.\n\nApr 26, 11:31 AM\n\nPecker reiterates that he didn't want Stormy Daniels' story\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker testified on cross-examination that the publication's limited involvement in Stormy Daniels' hush money payment was unrelated to the August 2015 Trump Tower meeting where Pecker vowed to serve as the \""eyes and ears\"" of Trump's presidential campaign.\n\nPecker's testimony on cross-examination about the Daniels story appeared consistent with his testimony yesterday about his strong desire not to be involved in the Stormy Daniels payment.\n\nPecker said yesterday that he did not want to be involved in the story due to concerns about reputational harm to the National Enquirer and a lack of reimbursement for the other payments he had made to suppress previous Trump stories.\n\n\""I said, we already paid $30,000 to the doorman, we paid $150,000 to Karen McDougal, and I am not a bank. I am not paying out any further disbursements among us,\"" Pecker testified yesterday. Pecker said he instructed National Enquirer Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard to flag the Stormy Daniels story to Michael Cohen, who made the payment to Daniels himself.\n\nAsked about Daniels' payment on cross-examination, Pecker said that the National Enquirer's limited involvement was unrelated to their vow to Trump.\n\n\""You did not consider the Stormy Daniels story to be part of any agreement you had in August 2015?\"" defense attorney Emil Bove asked.\n\n\""That is correct,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""You wanted nothing to do with it?\"" Bove said.\n\n\""That's correct,\"" Pecker said.\n\nPecker added that he did not \""authorize\"" Howard to continue communicating with Stormy Daniels' lawyer Keith Davidson about the payment.\n\nWhen Howard raised concerns to Pecker that Davidson had not yet been paid by Michael Cohen, Pecker said he was angry that Howard continued to communicate with Davidson about the story. In addition to the nature of the story -- which Pecker said could endanger the National Enquirer's relationship with its distributors -- Pecker said Cohen's delay in paying Daniels' lawyer could result in reputational harm to the National Enquirer.\n\n\""Frankly, you were not happy to be hearing that?\"" Bove asked about Cohen's delayed payment.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""The main concern was Howard's reputation?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\nApr 26, 10:55 AM\n\nDefense questions Pecker about Michael Cohen\n\nDavid Pecker might be the only witness on the stand, but defense attorneys appear to be using the former National Enquirer publisher's testimony to go after Michael Cohen.\n\nUnder questioning from defense attorney Emil Bove, Pecker said that Cohen at one point asked for his help getting a job with a New-Jersey based company. It wasn't clear when exactly the request was made.\n\nThe company promptly rejected the offer, Pecker testified.\n\n\""They had no interest in Michael Cohen,\"" Pecker said bluntly.\n\nPecker also testified that Cohen asked for help sending paparazzi to one of his meetings, then publishing the photos in the National Enquirer.\n\n\""That would put pressure on President Trump to treat Cohen differently?\"" Bove asked about why Cohen wanted the paparazzi.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\nBove's use of the term \""President Trump\"" whenever he references his client led to a minor complaint from prosecutors this morning.\n\n\""He was not president Trump in June of 2016,\"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass said.\n\nApr 26, 10:43 AM\n\nPecker says 'catch and kill' wasn't discussed at meeting\n\nDefense attorney Emil Bove sought to distance former President Trump from the National Enquirer's purchase of negative stories about him and instead suggested David Pecker and Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen may have been freelancing.\n\nBove asked Pecker about a meeting at Trump Tower in August 2015 where Pecker previously testified he agreed to be the \""eyes and ears\"" of the Trump campaign.\n\n\""At that meeting, the concept of catch and kill was not discussed, correct?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""That's correct,\"" Pecker answered.\n\nThe defense also sought to reframe the Enquirer's $30,000 purchase of Trump World Tower doorman Dino Sajudin's false claim that Trump fathered a love child.\n\nBove suggested Enquirer parent AMI purchased the story not to help the Trump campaign, but because it was an irresistible tabloid scoop.\n\n\""Sajudin threatened to go somewhere else?\"" Bove asked. \""Yes,\"" Pecker responded.\n\n\""That is why you paid him $30,000?\"" Bove asked. \""It would be too great a loss to AMI to lose the story, if true?\""\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker answered.\n\n\""You could not walk away from that possibility?\"" asked Bove.\n\n\""Yes,\"" replied Pecker.\n\nApr 26, 10:28 AM\n\nPecker says arrangement supporting Trump wasn't unusual\n\nTrump attorney Emil Bove, continuing his cross-examination of former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker, returned to a theme he emphasized yesterday: that the National Enquirer's supportive arrangement with Trump was not unique, but rather \""standard operating procedure.\""\n\nBove is seeking to establish that negative stories about Donald Trump's political opponents in the National Enquirer largely involved \""information that was already in the public domain\"" -- recycled narratives and reporting found in other outlets.\n\n\""There wasn't much new content in those stories, was there?\"" Bove asked Pecker.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""It was a business decision that it was good for the National Enquirer to run those stories,\"" Bove said, adding that, as a business model, it was \""quick, efficient, and cost-effective\"" -- to which Pecker agreed.\n\nBove cited stories about Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson as examples.\n\nApr 26, 9:49 AM\n\nDefense resumes cross-examination of David Pecker\n\n\""Good morning, everyone,\"" Judge Juan Merchan said at the start of the proceedings. \""Good morning, Mr. Trump.\""\n\nTrump did not audibly respond.

Because I don't think you are responding to what I am saying.\""\n\nMerchan said that the jurors will be corrected about the alleged misimpression at the start of court tomorrow.\n\nThe judge then adjourned the day's proceedings, with court scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. ET Friday.\n\nApr 25, 4:31 PM\n\nPecker says AMI paid to kill stories for Schwarzenegger\n\nIn his cross-examination of David Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher who ran the publication's parent company, AMI, defense lawyer Emil Bove sought to draw a contrast between AMI's conduct with Donald Trump and its work with another celebrity-turned-politician: Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nEarlier today, Pecker testified about an agreement with Schwarzenegger ahead of the actor's run for California governor. According to Pecker, Schwarzenegger agreed to serve as an editor-at-large for some of AMI's fitness magazines in exchange for help quashing negative stories about Schwarzenegger's past interactions with women.\n\n\""A number of women called up the National Enquirer about stories that they have to sell on different relationships or contacts and sexual harassment they felt that Arnold Schwarzenegger did,\"" Pecker said. \""The agreement I had with Arnold was I would call him and advise him of any stories that were out there.\""\n\nPecker described that his arrangement with Schwarzenegger -- which he said resulted in an \""embarrassing\"" investigation into AMI's conduct -- provided him with some foundational experience when he began identifying and killing stories for Trump.\n\n\""That's how I became sensitive on this topic,\"" Pecker.\n\nPressed on cross-examination about the arrangement with Schwarzenegger, Pecker acknowledged that AMI spent its own money to kill stories about the former California governor.\n\n\""It was hundreds of thousands of dollars,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""And Mr. Schwarzenegger never paid you back for that?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""No, he didn't,\"" Pecker said.\n\nPecker also testified about an effort to compel Tiger Woods to do an interview with AMI's fitness magazines by purchasing a negative story about him as leverage.\n\nApr 25, 4:15 PM\n\nPecker tells defense that killing stories is 'standard' procedure\n\nFormer President Trump's attorney Emil Bove began his cross-examination of Former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker by seeking to painting Pecker and Trump's \""mutually beneficially\"" relationship as one that had nothing to do with the election but rather had been underway for years under a \""standard operating procedure.\""\n\n\""Seventeen years of providing President Trump with a heads-up about potentially negative publicity?\"" Bove asked Pecker.\n\n\""That's correct,\"" Pecker said.\n\nBove asked Pecker about the first time he ever provided Trump with information -- which Pecker testified was in the 1990s and related to a negative story about Marla Maples, Trump's ex-wife.\n\n\""Fair to say that predated the Trump Tower meeting by a long time?\"" Bove asked of Pecker and Trump's relationship.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""A lot of interactions?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker responded.\n\nBove also sought to show that kind of relationship between publishers and politicians was normal, saying there was \""nothing wrong about\"" it.\n\n\""You are aware many politicians work with the media to try to promote their image?\"" Bove asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker responded.\n\n\""That's standard operating procedure?\"" Bove again asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""And sometimes when politicians are doing that, that is to try to win elections?\"" Bove continued.\n\n\""Right,\"" Pecker responded.\n\n\""Nothing wrong about that?\"" Bove asked.\n\nApr 25, 3:29 PM\n\n'I still consider him a friend,' Pecker says of Trump\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker concluded his direct examination by offering kind words about the former president.\n\n\""I felt that Donald Trump was my mentor.

Trump's lawyers have argued that the former president's comments about Cohen -- which prosecutors allege were in violation of the case's limited gag order -- were in response to political attacks by Cohen.\n\n\""Despite not being the gagged defendant, out of respect for Judge Merchan and the prosecutors, I will cease posting anything about Donald on my X (formerly Twitter) account or on the Mea Culpa Podcast until after my trial testimony. See you all in a month (or more),\"" Cohen said on social media on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nTrump's lawyer Todd Blanche devoted a portion of his opening statement on Monday to attacking Cohen's credibility, describing the former lawyer as a \""convicted perjurer\"" and \""admitted liar\"" who has an \""obsession with getting Trump.\""\n\nCohen's testimony is expected to be a key part of the state's case against Trump, as prosecutors attempt to prove that Trump falsified business records as he, Cohen and former National Enquirer publisher David Pecker engaged in a conspiracy to influence the 2016 election by suppressing negative stories about Trump.\n\nApr 23, 2:34 PM\n\nTrump again assails judge for limited gag order\n\nFormer President Trump, addressing reporters after court was adjourned for the day, angrily criticized Judge Merchan and the limited gag order that was the topic of this morning's contempt hearing.\n\n\""We have a gag order, which to me is totally unconstitutional.

By then, he was speaking to Cohen \""a couple times a week,\"" but that soon changed. Pecker said he and Cohen spoke \""much more frequently\"" about McDougal's claims.\n\n\""Michael was very agitated.

I told him that the doorman is very difficult to deal with,\"" Pecker testified.\n\nCohen had earlier encouraged Pecker to add a $1 million penalty to Sajudin's contract if he broke the agreement and tried to shop around the story.\n\n\""He would breach this agreement and owe American Media a million dollars,\"" Pecker said. \""It was basically a lever over him to make sure that wouldn't happen.\""\n\nCohen encouraged Pecker to keep Sajudin locked in, according to the former publisher.\n\n\""I am going release him one way or the other,\"" Pecker said he told Cohen regarding Sajudin. \""He said, 'No, release him after the election.'\""\n\n\""When was he released?\"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass asked Pecker.\n\n\""December 9, 2016,\"" Pecker said.\n\n\""After the presidential election?\"" Steinglass asked.\n\n\""Yes,\"" Pecker responded.\n\nApr 23, 1:48 PM\n\nPecker details catch-and-kill deal with Trump Tower doorman\n\nFormer National Enquirer publisher David Pecker described the very first story he \""caught and killed\"" pursuant to his agreement with Donald Trump and his then-attorney Michael Cohen: a false story from a Trump Tower doorman in 2015.\n\nTrump, sitting at the defense table, shook his head when Pecker laid out the allegation: that \""Donald Trump fathered an illegitimate girl with a maid at Trump Tower.\""\n\nPecker testified that he \""immediately called Michael Cohen\"" when his team got wind of those allegations being shopped by the doorman, Dino Sajudin. Cohen told him it was \""absolutely not true\"" -- but Pecker testified he ultimately moved forward with buying the story to the tune of $30,000.\n\n\""This could be a very big story.

And he wasn't very good in a lot of ways, in terms of his representation, but he represented a lot of people.\""\n\n\""And also, the things he got in trouble for were things that had nothing to do with me.

Prosecutors believe he is key to understanding Trump\u2019s motivation for paying off Stormy Daniels so damaging information did not seep into the 2016 campaign.\n\nApr 22, 1:28 PM\n\nTrump, after court, says payments were correctly labeled\n\nMoments after his criminal trial adjourned for the day, Donald Trump exited the courtroom and told reporters that his payments to Michael Cohen were appropriately labeled as legal expenses.\n\n\""Actually, nobody's been able to say what you're supposed to call it,\"" Trump told the media. \""If the lawyer puts in a bill or an invoice and you pay the bill ... that's a very small little line ... it's not like you could tell a life story.\""\n\n\""They marked it down for a legal expense.

He is scheduled to return to the witness stand tomorrow at 11 a.m. ET.\n\nDuring his brief testimony, Pecker suggested that former National Enquirer Chief Content Officer Dylan Howard -- an alleged participant in the catch-and-kill scheme alleged by prosecutors -- will be unable to testify due to a medical condition.\n\nPecker appeared to greet Trump and his lawyers as he exited the courtroom.\n\nCourt subsequently wrapped for the day.\n\nTrump left the courtroom flanked by Secret Service agents and staffers, as well as Trump Organization General Counsel Alan Garten.\n\nJudge Merchan is scheduled to hold a contempt hearing about Trump\u2019s alleged violations of the case\u2019s limited gag order tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. ET.\n\nApr 22, 12:27 PM\n\nDavid Pecker takes the stand for prosecution\n\nDavid Pecker, who once called Donald Trump \""a personal friend of mine,\"" flashed a big smile as he took the stand as the trial's first witness, belying the gravity of the moment.\n\nPecker cackled loudly into the microphone, jolting the room, when prosecutor Josh Steinglass, asked him about his various phone numbers that he struggled to remember.\n\nPecker, 72, was the publisher of the National Enquirer but prosecutors said he was \""acting as a co-conspirator\"" in helping buy and bury damaging stories about Trump, including a doorman's false claim that Trump had fathered a love child and a Playboy model's claim of a sexual relationship with Trump, who has denied both allegations.\n\nTrump, who once said Pecker would make a \""brilliant\"" choice as editor of Time magazine, listened while leaning forward in his chair, arms crossed on the table, an unhappy look on his face.\n\nPecker testified that he had final say whether to publish any story involving a famous person.\n\n\""I had the final say of the celebrity side of the magazine,\"" Pecker said. \""We used checkbook journalism. We paid for stories.\""\n\nPecker is testifying pursuant to a subpoena. He has also secured a non-prosecution agreement with the Manhattan district attorney's office.\n\nApr 22, 12:10 PM\n\nProsecutors call David Pecker as 1st witness\n\nProsecutors have called former American Media Inc. executive David Pecker as their first witness.\n\nThe DA alleges that Pecker, who oversaw the National Enquirer, engaged in a conspiracy with Trump to help influence the 2016 election by killing negative stories about Trump.\n\nApr 22, 11:50 AM\n\nMichael Cohen obsessed with 'getting Trump,' defense claims\n\nIn his opening statement, defense attorney Todd Blanche sought to eviscerate Michael Cohen's credibility, saying Cohen is obsessed with Donald Trump, has a desire to see Trump incarcerated and has a propensity to lie.\n\n\""He has a goal, an obsession, with getting Trump. I submit to you he cannot be trusted,\"" Blanche said.\n\nOn Sunday night, Cohen publicly posted online that he had a \""mental excitement about this trial\"" and the testimony he would deliver, Blanche said.\n\n\""His entire financial livelihood depends on President Trump's destruction,\"" Blanche said. \""You cannot make a serious decision about President Trump by relying on the words of Michael Cohen.\n\nApr 22, 11:47 AM\n\nTrump had 'nothing to do,' with invoices, defense says\n\n\""I have a spoiler alert,\"" defense attorney Todd Blanche told jurors during his opening statement. \""There is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy.\""\n\nAmid frequent objections from prosecutors, Blanche argued that the Manhattan district attorney has attempted to make the payments and non-disclosure agreements between Trump and Stormy Daniels \""sinister\"" to the jury.\n\nJudge Merchan had to interrupt Blanche's opening after multiple objections from prosecutors, then he met the parties at a sidebar conference, after which he struck a line from Blanche's opening.\n\n\""There is nothing illegal about entering into a non-disclosure agreement. Period,\"" Blanche restated after the portion of his opening was struck from the record.\n\nBlanche's opening has come off more casual and off-the-cuff than the state's opening, with Blanche improvising and posing hypotheticals to argue that accountants at the Trump Organization did not run the invoices by Trump as he was \""running the country.\""\n\n\""'Hey, we got this invoice. I know we are trying to cover it up here,'\"" Blanche said sarcastically about how prosecutors described how accountants received invoices from Cohen. \""Absolutely not.\""\n\nAccording to Blanche, Trump was unaware of how the invoices were processed by his employees.\n\n\""President Trump has nothing to do -- nothing to do -- with the invoice, with the check being generated, or with the entry on the ledger,\"" Blanche said, arguing that Trump was busy \""in the White House while he was running the country.\""\n\n\""The reality is that President Trump is not on the hook -- criminally responsible -- for something Michael Cohen might have done years after the fact. The evidence will prove otherwise,\"" Blanche said.\n\nApr 22, 11:38 AM\n\n'None of this was a crime,' defense attorney says\n\nDonald Trump is \""not just our former president, he's not just Donald Trump that you've seen on TV,\"" said defense attorney Todd Blanche in his opening statement.\n\n\""He's also a man. He's a husband,\"" Blanche said. \""He's a father.\""\n\nBlanche pushed back on the DA's overall allegation that the payments to Trump's attorney Michael Cohen were weren't only payback for Stormy Daniels by using the prosecutor's own words against him.\n\nBlanche noted that Cohen paid $130,000 to Daniels, but that Trump paid back Cohen a total of $420,000. If Trump really was a frugal businessman, as prosecutors said, why would he overpay that money, Blanche asked.\n\n\""Ask yourself, would a frugal businessman, a man who pinched his pennies, repay a $130,000 debt to the tune of $420,000?\"" Blanche asked.\n\nBlanche repeatedly reiterated that Cohen truly was an attorney for Trump and was doing legal work for him, pointing out that Michael Cohen's own email signature noted he was Trump's attorney.\n\n\""None of this was a crime,\"" Blanche said, saying the 34 counts against Trump \""are really just 34 pieces of paper.\""\n\nApr 22, 11:30 AM\n\nTrump 'did not commit any crimes,' defense tells jury\n\n\""President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes,\"" defense attorney Todd Blanche said to begin the defense's opening statements.\n\n\""The Manhattan district attorney's office should never have brought this case,\"" Blanche said.\n\n\""You will hear me and others refer to him as President Trump. That is a title he has earned because he was our 45th President,\"" Blanche added.\n\n\n\nApr 22, 11:26 AM\n\nProsecutor says jury can believe Cohen despite mistakes\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo told the jury, during his opening statement, \""During this trial you're going to hear a lot about Michael Cohen.\u201d\n\nTrump's former personal attorney, Cohen is a key witness -- perhaps the only one that will testify to Donald Trump\u2019s intent when he agreed to pay Stormy Daniels hush money.\n\nThe defense \u201cwill go to great lengths\u201d to convince the jury Cohen is not credible, Colangelo said.\n\nHe acknowledged that Cohen had earlier lied regarding the matter. \u201cHe lied about it to protect his boss,\u201d Colangelo said. \u201cYou will also learn that Michael Cohen has a criminal record.\u201d\n\nColangelo told jurors they can believe Cohen despite his past mistakes.\n\n\u201cCohen's testimony will be backed up by testimony from other witnesses you will hear from, including David Pecker, Keith Davidson. It will be backed up by an extensive paper trail. And it will be backed up by Donald Trump\u2019s own words,\u201d the prosecutor said.\n\nColangelo concluded by saying, \u201cThis case is about a criminal conspiracy and a cover-up, an illegal conspiracy to undermine the integrity of a presidential election and then the steps that Donald Trump took to conceal that election fraud. At the end of the case we are confident you will have no reasonable doubt that Donald Trump is guilty of falsifying business records.\u201d\n\nApr 22, 11:16 AM\n\n'It was election fraud, pure and simple,' prosecutor says\n\n\""It was election fraud, pure and simple,\"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the jury during opening statements as he outlined the hush payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels and how it was logged by the Trump Organization\n\nDylan Howard, then editor of the National Enquirer, had called Trump attorney Michael Cohen to inform him about Daniels and the story that she had of a sexual liaison with Trump, which the former president has long denied.\n\n\""Cohen then discussed the situation with Trump who is adamant that he did not want the story to come out,\"" Colangelo said. \""it could have been devastating to his campaign.\""\n\nAt the time, Trump and the campaign were \""deeply concerned\"" about the \""Access Hollywood\"" video, the prosecutor said. Cohen wired the $130,000 to Daniels' lawyer to keep her quiet.\n\n\""Cohen made that payment at Donald Trump's direction and for his benefit and he did it with the special goal of influencing the election\n\nThis was not spin or communications strategy. This was a planned, coordinated long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election to help DT get elected through illegal expenditures to silence people who had something bad about his behavior. It was election fraud, pure and simple,\"" Colangelo said.\n\nApr 22, 11:10 AM\n\n'Access Hollywood' tape was 'explosive,' prosecutors claim\n\nProsecutor Matthew Colangelo read aloud part of the transcript of the infamous \""Access Hollywood\"" tape to jurors.\n\n\""You can do anything,\"" Colangelo slowly read to the jurors, quoting Trump from the tape. \""Grab them by the p----. You can do anything.\""\n\nAccording to Colangelo, the October 2016 release of the tape had an \""immediate and explosive\"" impact on Donald Trump's presidential campaign.\n\n\""Seeing and hearing a candidate in his own words, in his own voice, with his own body language ... has a much greater impact on voters than words on paper,\"" Colangelo said. \""The campaign went on immediate damage control mode to blunt the impact of the tape.\""\n\nThe campaign was concerned about the impact it might have on Trump voters or even the possibility that Trump could lose the Republican nomination one month out from the election, according to Colangelo.\n\n\""The Republican National Committee even considered whether it was too late to replace their own nominee,\"" Colangelo said.\n\nApr 22, 11:04 AM\n\nTrump, listening to openings, shakes his head\n\nFormer President Trump, sitting at the defense table, softly shook his head \""no\"" when prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told the jurors that Trump formed a \""conspiracy\"" with Michael Cohen and David Pecker to \""help him get elected.\""\n\nIt was one of the most notable reactions from Trump as he sits and listens to prosecutors lay out their story of the case.\n\nColangelo then brought up the \""Access Hollywood\"" tape and said it showed Trump \""bragging about sexual assault,\"" Trump shook his head no again, pursing his lips. He did not react when Colangelo, quoting Trump on the tape, said, \""grab them by the p----.\""\n\nEarlier, as Colangelo brought up a former Trump doorman who was he said was paid off as part of the alleged catch-and-kill scheme, Trump -- looking annoyed -- leaned over and tapped his lawyer Todd Blanche. When Colangelo said the doorman was paid $30,000 to bury his story, Trump raised his eyebrows and grabbed onto a pen.\n\nThe former president has been passing notes and sliding papers between Blanche and attorney Emil Bove, and leaning side-to-side, whispering to them. Blanche at one point pulled out his own sticky note and slid a note back to Trump.\n\nAt other times he has hardly seemed engaged at all, slumping in his red leather chair looking straight forward with no facial expression, or fidgeting with his head tilting back and forth. At one point during jury instructions he let out a yawn.\n\nApr 22, 10:48 AM\n\nProsecutor alleges 3-prong conspiracy\n\n\""It starts with that August 2015 meeting in Trump Tower,\"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo told jurors about the alleged conspiracy, in his opening statement.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Donald Trump, his then-lawyer Michael Cohen, and AMI executive David Pecker, the three engaged in a three-prong conspiracy to help influence the 2016 election, according to Colangelo.\n\nFirst, the National Enquirer would run \""headline after headline that extolled the defendant's virtues,\"" according to Colangelo.\n\n\""Pecker had the ultimate say over publication decisions,\"" Colangelo said, adding that Trump edited, killed, and suggested the cover of the magazine.\n\nSecond, the National Enquirer would run negative stories attacking Trump's opponents in the 2016 Republican primary, such as attacks on Ben Caron or Marco Rubio.\n\nThird, the \""core of the conspiracy\"" was killing negative stories about Trump -- evolving into the catch-and kill scheme, Colangelo said.\n\n\""The National Enquirer ran these stories as part of the conspiracy launched after the Trump Tower meeting,\"" he said.\n\nApr 22, 10:40 AM\n\n'This case is about a criminal conspiracy,' prosecutor says\n\n\""This case is about a criminal conspiracy,\"" prosecutor Matthew Colangelo began his opening statement in Donald Trump's criminal trial in New York.\n\n\""The defendant, Donald Trump, orchestrated a criminal scheme to corrupt the 2016 presidential election,\"" the prosecutor said.\n\nThe utterance represents the first time a prosecutor has sought to implicate a former president in a crime at his trial.\n\nColangelo said Trump schemed with his attorney Michael Cohen and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker \""to influence the presidential election by concealing negative information about former President Trump.\""\n\nTrump slouched in his seat the defense table, listening.\n\n\""The defendant said in his business records that he was paying Cohen for legal services pursuant to a retainer agreement.

Donald Trump,\u201d Merchan told the 12 jurors and six alternates.\n\nMerchan emphasized that the burden of proof rests on the prosecutors and that jurors should presume that Trump is innocent. A guilty verdict requires that each juror determines that the state proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt, Merchan said.\n\n\u201cThe defendant is presumed to be innocent,\u201d Merchan said. \u201cIt is not sufficient to prove that the defendant is probably guilty.\u201d\n\nMerchan attempted to set expectations for the jurors, only two of which have ever served on a jury before. For example, Merchan told the jurors not to expect the lawyers to launch into lengthy speeches outside of the opening and closing statements.\n\n\u201cThat happens in TV and in movies, but it doesn\u2019t happen in real trials,\u201d Merchan said.\n\nApr 22, 10:09 AM\n\nJudge issues mixed ruling on cross-examination of Trump\n\nJudge Juan Merchan ruled that if Trump takes the stand, prosecutors can question him about a number of previous legal issues -- but the judge limited the scope of the cases and the extent to which prosecutors can question him about the facts of those cases.\n\nThe ruling is a mixed bag for Trump, who had sought to entirely block questioning on these previous issues if he takes the stand.\n\nJudge Merchan ruled that Trump can be questioned by the DA's office on six determinations from four previous proceedings, including aspects of his New York civil fraud case and the gag order violations there, as well as both E. Jean Carrol verdicts and the Trump foundation case.\n\nProsecutors had originally asked to question Trump about six different proceedings with 13 total determinations.\n\nMerchan said with his ruling, he has \""greatly curtailed\"" how much prosecutors can discuss the underlying facts of those cases.\n\n\""The court cautions the defendant that this Sandoval ruling is a shield, not a sword,\"" Merchan said.\n\nApr 22, 9:59 AM\n\nSchedule set for today's proceedings\n\nProsecutors told Judge Merchan that they need 40 minutes for their opening statements.\n\nDefense attorneys told the judge they need 25 minutes.\n\nThe judge also announced that court will break at 12:30 p.m. ET today, after a juror had a toothache and got an emergency appointment this afternoon.\n\nCourt had already been scheduled to end early today, at 2 p.m. ET, due to the Passover holiday.\n\nApr 22, 9:52 AM\n\nIssue with Juror No. 9 is resolved\n\nJudge Juan Merchan announced there is an issue with Juror No. 9 -- who, according to Merchan, \""was concerned about media attention\"" of the case. According to Merchan, the juror \""wasn't 100% sure\"" they could serve.\n\nMerchan said they would speak to the juror in chambers to \""find out what the issue is and see if this juror can continue to serve.\""\n\nAfter a brief sidebar, the judge announced: \u201cJuror No. 9 is going to remain with us.\u201d\n\nThere are six alternate jurors seated in case any of the 12 jurors cannot serve.\n\nApr 22, 9:44 AM\n\nTrump tells reporters it's a 'sad day in America'\n\nOn his way into the courtroom for the day's proceedings, Trump once again alleged that the trial constitutes election interference, claiming that the proceedings are unfairly keeping him off the campaign trail.\n\n\""Everybody knows that I'm here instead of being able to be in Pennsylvania and Georgia and lots of other places campaigning, and it's very unfair,\"" he told reporters.\n\n\""It's a very, very sad day in America,\"" he said. \""I can tell you that.\""\n\nThe former president is seated at the defense table between his lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove.\n\nApr 22, 9:37 AM\n\nProceedings are underway\n\nThe proceedings are underway in former President Donald Trump's hush money trial.

Then-Trump attorney Michael Cohen allegedly insisted that the deal stay in place even after AMI discovered the allegation was false, and AMI paid the doorman, according to the Manhattan DA.\n\nApr 22, 5:55 AM\n\nAttorneys to present opening statements in historic trial\n\nAfter a week-long selection process, the jurors in Donald Trump's New York hush money case will hear opening statements Monday in the first criminal trial of a former United States president.\n\nTo prove their case, lawyers for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg need to convince 12 jurors beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump repeatedly falsified records related to unlawfully influencing the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\""This case has nothing to do with your personal politics or your feelings about a particular political issue,\"" prosecutor Joshua Steinglass told potential jurors on Thursday. \""It's not a referendum on the Trump Presidency, a popularity contest, or any indication of who you plan to vote for this fall.

The EU already has an inquiry into Chinese government backing for electric-car manufacturers that could lead to new tariffs, and it\u2019s scrutinizing other industries like wind energy, solar and railways.\n\nEU relations with Beijing have been deteriorating over the past year and more, as Europe becomes more assertive in responding to China\u2019s trade policies. European leaders have pushed back against China\u2019s surge in manufacturing capacity, its massive trade surplus and its support for Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe probe is the first use of the bloc\u2019s so-called International Procurement Instrument, a 2022 law that\u2019s meant to promote reciprocity in access to public procurement markets.\n\nThe investigation was first reported by Bloomberg last week and will initially focus on information gathering from companies and member states before authorities start talks with Beijing on fair and open markets. The probe will need to be concluded within nine months.\n\nIf the EU finds a lack of reciprocity in procurement markets then it could restrict Chinese access to the bloc\u2019s tenders. Should a dialog with Beijing lead to tangible corrective actions, the probe can be suspended at any time.\n\nThe EU argues that Beijing has been pushing market-distorting measures and practices to implement its \u201cMade in China\u201d policy and its target of achieving 85% domestic market share for Chinese companies producing \u201ccore medical device components\u201d by 2025. The target is 70% for higher-end devices.\n\nThe bloc also claims the Chinese government discriminates against imported products and has, at times, imposed stringent requirements on foreign firms, including investment obligations or technology transfers to Chinese entities.\n\nBeijing\u2019s focus on local and state-oriented procurement in medical technologies has increased in recent years, as authorities across the country included strict domestic product requirements for many categories of devices. The shift turned a \u20ac1.3 billion ($1.4 billion) trade deficit in these goods for China in 2019 into a \u20ac5.2 billion ($5.5 billion) surplus just one year later, according to data cited in an EU report published earlier this month.\n\nAnti-Subsidy Raid\n\nIn another move this week, EU watchdogs raided the European premises of a security equipment company Tuesday under new anti-subsidy laws. While the firm\u2019s nationality wasn\u2019t specified, China\u2019s chamber of commerce in the EU said it was \u201cshocked.\u201d\n\nNuctech, a state-owned company best known for manufacturing baggage inspection devices used in airports across the world, confirmed to Bloomberg that it was \u201cfully cooperating\u201d with the EU but declined to confirm if it was inspected.\n\nIn 2020, the US government European governments against the use of Nuctech\u2019s devices, accusing them of being a security risk.\n\nMarket Access\n\nThe EU\u2019s access to China\u2019s procurement market has long been a grievance, with the issue raised by both European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the bloc\u2019s trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis during trips to the country last year. Other issues include opaquely defined market-access terms, the transfer of industrial data out of China and invasive requirements imposed on cosmetic firms.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, our repeated discussions with China on this trade irritant have been fruitless,\u201d Dombrovskis said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cWe trust that this IPI investigation will galvanize our dialog and help us find mutually agreeable solutions.\u201d\n\nTalks over the past 12 months have seen little movement, Bloomberg previously reported.\n\nChina\u2019s medical technology market was valued at \u20ac135 billion ($145 billion) in 2022, according to Merics, a research institute focusing on China. Major European manufacturers operating in the industry include Siemens and Philips.\n\nIn Beijing last week, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned that Europe will erect more trade defenses if Beijing doesn\u2019t heed the concerns about unfair competition, dumping and overcapacity. China argues that the US and Europe are using such critiques as an excuse for protectionist policies that shield their own less-competitive firms.\n\nAll these issues, along with Europe\u2019s calls for China to stop aiding Russia, are likely to be high on the agenda when Xi travels to Europe in early May. He\u2019s due to visit EU members France and Hungary, as well as Serbia.\n\nChina is one of Europe\u2019s biggest trading partners, but the top EU diplomat in charge of Asia relations was critical this week of the huge export surplus China runs with the bloc.\n\n\u201cChinese over-capacities and trade imbalances, they are a major factor of course influencing our relationship,\u201d Niclas Kvarnstrom, managing director for Asia at the European External Action Service, said in an interview. \u201cWe certainly think it requires action on their side.\u201d\n\nSpying Arrests\n\nOn top of the economic disagreements, the arrest this week of four people in Germany on accusations of spying for China will add to the tension. Three were detained Monday on suspicion of working for Chinese state security to acquire industrial secrets, while another person was arrested Tuesday in connection with spying on the European parliament and Chinese opposition figures.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry hit back at the spying arrests.\n\n\u201cI hope that relevant people in Germany will ditch the Cold War mentality and stop manipulating political narratives against China by raising this so-called spy risk,\u201d spokesman Wang Wenbin said Tuesday. \u201cWe firmly oppose this hyping up and also urge relevant sides to stop spreading misinformation.\u201d\n\nEurope last year launched an anti-subsidy investigation into electric vehicles made in China that could see new tariffs introduced by July. It reflects growing concern about Beijing\u2019s financial support for critical industries, which threatens to swamp would-be competitors in Europe, and a broader EU security strategy that seeks to toughen export controls and investment screenings.\n\nChinese leaders have pushed back against European and US criticism that Beijing has skewed China\u2019s market in favor of its companies.\n\n\u201cIndustrial subsidies are a common practice in the world,\u201d Chinese Premier Li Qiang said in his talks with Scholz last week, according to a German government transcript. \u201cMany countries have much more subsidies than China.\u201d\n\nThe EU\u2019s approach aligns with a firmer US stance against China.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Chinese leaders during her visit last month that the country\u2019s ramped-up factory output has become a global problem. The US won\u2019t take \u201canything off the table,\u201d including the possibility of additional tariffs, to stem the flood of Chinese goods, she told CNN earlier this month.\n\n--With assistance from Sangmi Cha and Samuel Stolton.\n\n(Updates with detalls on separate raid of Chinese company starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.""","The European Union (EU) has launched an investigation into China's procurement of medical devices, suspecting unfair favoritism of domestic suppliers. This is the first use of the International Procurement Instrument, a 2022 law promoting reciprocity in access to public procurement markets. The probe will gather information from companies and member states, and could result in restricted Chinese access to EU tenders if reciprocity is not found. The EU is concerned about China's ""Made in China"" policy and alleged discriminatory practices against imported products. The investigation follows tensions over China's trade policies, manufacturing capacity, trade surplus, and support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The EU and China are also discussing market-access terms, data transfer, and cosmetic firm requirements. China is one of Europe's biggest trading partners, but the EU has expressed concerns about Chinese over-capacities and trade imbalances. Recently, four people were arrested in Germany on accusations of spying for China, further straining EU-China relations.",undetermined,"1. Potential Trade Barriers: The EU's investigation into China's procurement of medical devices could lead to new tariffs or restrictions on Chinese access to the EU's tenders. This could impact the competitiveness of Chinese companies, including those in the medical device industry, which could in turn affect the profitability of companies like Paramount that do business with these Chinese companies.

2. Market Access: The EU has long been critical of its limited access to China's procurement market, and this issue has been raised by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis. If the EU's investigation leads to improved market access for European companies, this could increase competition for Paramount and other American companies in the Chinese market.

3. Broader Trade Tensions: The EU's investigation is part of a broader trend of trade tensions between the US, Europe, and China. These tensions could lead to increased protectionism and trade barriers, which could negatively impact Paramount's business with Chinese and European companies. Additionally, the arrest of four people in Germany on accusations of spying for China could further escalate tensions and create additional risks for Paramount and other companies operating in the region."

The Colombian company she built, which once employed 300 mostly female employees, declared bankruptcy and stopped operating after her arrest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey also argued that only 1% of the merchandise she imported into the U.S. lacked proper authorization and were samples for New York Fashion week and other events.\n\nGonzalez, addressing the court before sentencing, said she deeply regretted not meticulously complying with U.S. laws and that her only wish is to hug once more her 103-year-old mother.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFrom the bottom of my heart, I apologize to the United States of America.

2. Potential Legal Involvement: Although ING Groep is not directly involved in the case, any potential legal proceedings or investigations could have indirect consequences for the company. If any of the individuals or entities involved in the case have financial ties to ING Groep, the company may face regulatory scrutiny, leading to potential fines or sanctions, which could negatively impact the stock price.

John Wiik likes to think of himself as a lookout of sorts \u2014 keeping an eye on new laws, programs and ideas brewing across the states.\u201cI don\u2019t bring a ton of legislation,\u201d said Wiik, a Republican. \u201cThe main thing I like to do is try and stay ahead of trends and try and prevent bad things from coming into our state.\u201dThis session, that meant sponsoring successful legislation banning cities or counties from creating basic income programs, which provide direct, regular cash payments to low-income residents to help alleviate poverty.While Wiik isn\u2019t aware of any local governments publicly floating the idea in South Dakota, he describes such programs as \u201cbureaucrats trying to hand out checks to make sure that your party registration matches whoever signed the checks for the rest of your life.\u201dThe economic gut punch of the pandemic and related assistance efforts such as the expanded child tax credit popularized the idea of directly handing cash to people in need. Advocates say the programs can be administered more efficiently than traditional government assistance programs, and research suggests they increase not only financial stability but also mental and physical health.Still, Wiik and other Republicans argue handing out no-strings-attached cash disincentivizes work \u2014 and having fewer workers available is especially worrisome in a state with the nation\u2019s second-lowest unemployment rate. South Dakota is among at least six states where GOP officials have looked to ban basic income programs.The basic income concept has been around for decades, but a 2019 experiment in Stockton, California, set off a major expansion. There, 125 individuals received $500 per month with no strings attached for two years. Independent researchers found the program improved financial stability and health, but concluded that the pandemic dampened those effects.GOP lawmakers like Wiik fear that even experimental programs could set a dangerous precedent.\u201cWhat did Ronald Reagan say, \u2018The closest thing to eternal life on this planet is a government program\u2019?\u201d Wiik said. \u201cSo, if you get people addicted to just getting a check from the government, it\u2019s going to be really hard to take that away.\u201dThe debate over basic income programs is likely to intensify as blue state lawmakers seek to expand pilot programs. Minnesota, for example, could become the nation\u2019s first to fund a statewide program. But elected officials in red states are working to thwart such efforts \u2014 not only by fighting statewide efforts but also by preventing local communities from starting their own basic income programs.Democratic governors in Arizona and Wisconsin recently vetoed Republican legislation banning basic income programs.This month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Harris County to block a pilot program that would provide $500 per month to 1,900 low-income people in the state\u2019s largest county, home to Houston.Paxton, a Republican, argued the program is illegal because it violates a state constitutional provision that says local governments cannot grant public money to individuals.Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee, a Democrat, called Paxton\u2019s move \u201cnothing more than an attack on local government and an attempt to make headlines.\u201dMeanwhile, several blue states are pushing to expand these programs.Washington state lawmakers debated a statewide basic income bill during this year\u2019s short session. And Minnesota lawmakers are debating whether to spend $100 million to roll out one of the nation\u2019s first statewide pilot programs.\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing that shift from pilot to policy,\u201d said Sukhi Samra, the director of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, which formed after the Stockton experiment.So far, that organization has helped launch about 60 pilot programs across the country that will provide $250 million in unconditional aid, she said.Despite pushback in some states, Samra said recent polling commissioned by the group shows broad support of basic income programs. And the programs have shown success in supplementing \u2014 not replacing \u2014 social safety net programs, she said.The extra cash gives recipients freedom of choice. People can fix a flat tire, cover school supplies or celebrate a child\u2019s birthday for the first time.\u201cThere\u2019s no social safety net program that allows you to do that.\u201d she said. \u201c \u2026 This is an effective policy that helps our families, and this can radically change the way that we address poverty in this country.\u201dThe proliferation of basic income projects has been closely studied by researchers.Though many feared that free cash would dissuade people from working, that hasn\u2019t been the case, said Sara Kimberlin, the executive director and senior research scholar at Stanford University\u2019s Center on Poverty and Inequality.Stanford\u2019s Basic Income Lab has tracked more than 150 basic income pilots across the country. Generally, those offer $500 or $1,000 per month over a short period.\u201cThere isn\u2019t anywhere in the United States where you can live off of $500 a month,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, $500 a month really makes a tremendous difference for someone who is living really close to the edge.\u201dKimberlin said the research on basic income programs has so far been promising, though it\u2019s unclear how long the benefits may persist once programs conclude. Still, she said, plenty of research shows how critical economic stability in childhood is to stability in adulthood \u2014 something both the basic income programs and the pandemic-era child tax credit can address.Over the past five years, basic income experiments have varied across the country.Last year, California launched the nation\u2019s first state-funded pilot programs targeting former foster youth.In Colorado, the Denver Basic Income Project aimed to help homeless individuals. After early successes, the Denver City Council awarded funding late last year to extend that program , which provides up to $1,000 per month to hundreds of participants.A 2021 pilot launched in Cambridge, Massachusetts, provided $500 a month over 18 months to 130 single caregivers. Research from the University of Pennsylvania found the Cambridge program increased employment, the ability to cover a $400 emergency expense, and food and housing security among participants.Children in participating families were more likely to enroll in Advanced Placement courses, earned higher grades and had reduced absenteeism.\u201cIt was really reaffirming to hear that when families are not stressed out, they are able to actually do much better,\u201d said Geeta Pradhan, president of the Cambridge Community Foundation, which worked on the project.Pradhan said basic income programs are part of a national trend in \u201ctrust-based philanthropy,\u201d which empowers individuals rather than imposing top-down solutions to fight poverty.\u201cThere is something that I think it does to people\u2019s sense of empowerment, a sense of agency, the freedom that you feel,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that there\u2019s some very important aspects of humanity that are built into these programs.\u201dWhile the pilot concluded, the Cambridge City Council committed $22 million in federal pandemic aid toward a second round of funding. Now, nearly 2,000 families earning at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty level are receiving $500 monthly payments, said Sumbul Siddiqui, a city council member.Siddiqui, a Democrat, pushed for the original pilot when she was mayor during the pandemic. While she said the program has proven successful, it\u2019s unclear whether the city can find a sustainable source of funding to keep it going long term.Tomas Vargas Jr. was among the 125 people who benefited from the Stockton, California, basic income program that launched in 2019.At the time, he heard plenty of criticism from people who said beneficiaries would blow their funds on drugs and alcohol or quit their jobs.\u201cOff of $500 a month, which amazed me,\u201d said Vargas, who worked part time at UPS.But he said the cash gave him breathing room. He had felt stuck at his job, but the extra money gave him the freedom to take time off to interview for better jobs.Unlike other social service programs like food stamps, he didn\u2019t have to worry about losing out if his income went up incrementally. The cash allowed him to be a better father, he said, as well as improved his confidence and mental health.The experience prompted him to get into the nonprofit sector. Financially stable, he now works at Mayors for a Guaranteed Income.\u201cThe person I was five years ago is not the person that I am now,\u201d he said.Washington state Sen. Claire Wilson, a Democrat, said basic income is a proactive way to disrupt the status quo maintained by other anti-poverty efforts.\u201cI have a belief that our systems in our country have never been put in place to get people out of them,\u201d she said. \u201cThey kept people right where they are.\u201dWilson chairs the Human Services Committee, which considered a basic income bill this session that would have created a pilot program to offer 7,500 people a monthly amount equivalent to the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment in their area.The basic income bill didn\u2019t progress during Washington\u2019s short legislative session this year, but Wilson said lawmakers would reconsider the idea next year. While she champions the concept, she said there\u2019s a lot of work to be done convincing skeptics.In Minnesota, where lawmakers are considering a $100 million statewide basic income pilot program, some Republicans balked at the concept of free cash and its cost to taxpayers.\u201cJust the cost alone should be a concern,\u201d Republican state Rep. Jon Koznick said during a committee meeting this month State Rep. Athena Hollins, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation, acknowledged the hefty request, but said backers would support a scaled-down version and \u201cthought it was really important to get this conversation started.\u201dMuch of the conversation in committee centered on local programs in cities such as Minneapolis and St. Paul. St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, a Democrat, told lawmakers the city\u2019s 2020 pilot saw \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d results.After scraping by for years, some families were able to put money into savings for the first time, he said. Families experienced less anxiety and depression. And the pilot disproved the \u201cdisparaging tropes\u201d from critics about people living in poverty, the mayor said.Carter told lawmakers that the complex issue of economic insecurity demands statewide solutions.\u201cI am well aware that the policy we\u2019re proposing today is a departure from what we\u2019re all used to,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, that\u2019s one of my favorite things about it.\u201d""","Several states, including South Dakota, are looking to ban basic income programs that provide direct cash payments to low-income residents, citing concerns about disincentivizing work and creating dependency on government aid.

He needs to do the right thing to resign and allow us to move forward in a controlled process, and if he doesn\u2019t do so, he will be vacated,\u201d she said Sunday on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\nDelivering more aid for Ukraine has been stalled for months due to growing opposition within the GOP, some of which wanted to tie the funds to immigration and border policies that were dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate and with President Joe Biden. The Senate passed a bill with broad bipartisan margins weeks ago to deliver aid that was stalled out in the House due to a lack of Republican support.\n\nBut GOP leaders had their hands pressed with the Iranian attack against Israel earlier this month that added pressure to the need to pass another round of foreign aid.\n\nJohnson ultimately decided to move forward with a plan to provide the aid that included a series of bills that would rely on Democratic votes in order for them to pass after meetings with his conference, the White House and top U.S. intelligence officials, a move he knew would endanger his position.\n\n\""History judges us for what we do,\"" Johnson to reporters in the Capitol.\n\n\n\n\u201cI could make a selfish decision and do something that\u2019s different, but I'm doing here what I believe to be the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also said his own son\u2019s plans to join the Naval Academy in the fall influenced his thought process on the Ukraine aid, saying he would \u201crather send bullets to Ukraine than American boys.\u201d\n\nForeign aid was just the latest example of the with a one-seat majority and a group of hardline members of his own caucus threatening to oust him. There had been some growing dissatisfaction with GOP leadership over talks on the renewal of a warrantless surveillance program, the border and the budget.\n\nJohnson has had to rely on Democratic votes to pass key legislation numerous times in his short tenure as speaker, with each instance flaming tensions amid the members of his party that were considering supporting a motion to vacate.\n\nWhile there have been a handful of Republicans to sign onto Greene\u2019s motion, it appears unlikely to have the same levels of Democratic support as the move to boot McCarthy. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has already come out against removing Johnson and said other progressives in Congress would likely vote against it as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a progressive Democrat, and I think you would have a few progressive Democrats doing that,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd I disagree with Speaker Johnson on many issues and have been very critical of him. But he did the right thing here, and he deserves to keep his job until the end of this term.\u201d\n\nPrior to the package hitting the floor, Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal encouraging other Democrats to support Johnson to help Ukraine get sorely needed military aid as it tries to fend off Russian advances.\n\n\n\n\u201cDemocrats must offer Speaker Johnson our votes to save democracy in Ukraine and here. We can\u2019t let our partisan instincts get in our way. We must work with Republicans to disarm Mr. Putin\u2019s puppet, get a vote to support Ukraine, and defeat Russian disinformation. Our democracy is at stake,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMultiple Republicans have also come out against Greene\u2019s motion to vacate, pointing to the weeks-long fight after ousting McCarthy that ran through a litany of potential speakers before settling on Johnson, which included multiple members of leadership like Reps. Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer.\n\n\n\nNo other clear options have emerged in the event of a second vacated speakership despite some of the grumblings from Greene and others about what they see as Johnson\u2019s failures.""","House Speaker Mike Johnson faces pressure to resign or risk being vacated due to backlash from some Republican lawmakers, particularly over his handling of Ukraine aid. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced a motion to vacate him from the speakership, which has gained support from Republican Reps. Thomas Massie and Paul Gosar. Johnson moved forward with votes on bills providing $61 billion in aid to Ukraine, despite opposition within the GOP and the potential consequences for his position. Johnson said he believes providing aid to Ukraine is the right thing to do, and it was influenced by his son's plans to join the Naval Academy. While some Democrats have expressed dissatisfaction with GOP leadership, it is unlikely they will support Greene's motion to vacate Johnson. Multiple Republicans have also come out against Greene's motion, and no clear options have emerged in the event of a second vacated speakership.",undetermined,"1.

The State Department said Wednesday night that U.S. and Nigerien officials would meet Thursday in the capital, Niamey, \u201cto initiate discussions on an orderly and responsible withdrawal of U.S. forces.\u201d\n\nThat meeting comes as the two countries have been \u201cunable to reach an understanding\u201d to continue cooperation \u201cin a manner that addresses the needs and concerns of each side,\u201d State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said.\n\nThe government of neighboring Chad in recent days also has questioned its agreement with the U.S., Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Adm. Christopher Grady, the nation\u2019s second-highest-ranking military officer, said in an interview.\n\nThe agreements allow the U.S. to conduct critical counterterrorism operations within the countries\u2019 borders and have supported military partner training in both nations. The reversals have prompted concern that U.S. influence in Africa is losing ground to overtures from Russia and China.\n\n\u201cWe are all trying to establish ourselves as the partner of choice,\u201d Grady said. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to establish why we think our partnership with them is important. We certainly want to be there. We want to help them, we want to empower them, we want to do things by, with and through (them).\u201d\n\nWhile U.S. officials said Saturday that the military would begin plans to withdraw troops from Niger, they said discussions on a new military agreement were ongoing.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still negotiations underway,\u201d Grady said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there is a final decision on disposition of U.S. forces there.\u201d\n\nRelations have frayed between Niger and Western countries since mutinous soldiers ousted the country\u2019s democratically elected president in July. Niger\u2019s junta has since told French forces to leave and turned instead to Russia for security. Earlier this month, Russian military trainers arrived to reinforce the country\u2019s air defenses and with Russian equipment to train Nigeriens to use.\n\nThe government of Chad also recently requested that U.S. forces leave, and officials from the State Department, U.S. Africa Command and the Pentagon will work with Chad\u2019s government to make the case for U.S. forces to stay, Grady said.\n\n\u201cThe team has got get on the ground there and work it through,\u201d Grady said.\n\nHe said that if both countries ultimately decide the U.S. cannot remain there, the military will have to look for alternatives to run counterterrorism missions across the Sahel, a vast region south of the Sahara Desert.\n\n\u201cIf we are asked to leave, and after negotiations that\u2019s the way it plays out, then we are going to have to recalculate and figure out a new way to do it,\u201d Grady said.\n\nTara Copp, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n""","The U.S. has not made a final decision on withdrawing troops from Niger and Chad, as Niger's ruling junta and Chad's government have questioned agreements allowing U.S. counterterrorism operations in their countries. U.S. and Nigerien officials will meet to discuss a withdrawal, and the U.S. will try to convince Chad's government to keep U.S. forces. If both countries ask the U.S. to leave, the military will seek alternatives to run counterterrorism missions in the Sahel region. Relations with Niger have been strained since its junta told French forces to leave and turned to Russia for security.",undetermined,"1. Potential disruption of operations: Deutsche Post, like any other international company, relies on the smooth functioning of its supply chain and logistics operations. Any disruption in the security situation or political stability in the regions where the company operates, such as Niger and Chad, could impact its ability to deliver goods and services, thereby affecting its stock value.
2. Changes in market conditions: The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger and Chad could lead to changes in market conditions in these countries, which could in turn affect Deutsche Post's business prospects. For instance, if the security situation worsens, it could lead to a decline in economic activity, which could reduce the demand for logistics and transportation services.
3. Reputational risk: The news article highlights the growing influence of Russia and China in Africa, which could pose a reputational risk for Deutsche Post. If the company is perceived to be too closely associated with Western powers, it could face backlash from local governments or communities, which could negatively impact its business operations and, by extension, its stock value."
