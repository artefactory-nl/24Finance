The latest Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Report gives some comfort – private sector balance sheets are sound- but also comes with a warning about the debt-servicing capacity of smaller, riskier businesses in case of a sharp downturn in economic activity.

Developments in lending to business are traditionally more volatile over the cycle than those in lending to households. Recent ones have not deviated from this rule: in the autumn of 2023, at a time when the effects of the tightening of monetary policy were at their strongest, the impulse of lending to households did not fall as far, in absolute terms, as that for lending to businesses. Conversely, its recovery since then has been less vigorous.

This is relevant at the current juncture, considering that the recent hawkish twist in the tone of the Federal Reserve might continue to push US long-term interest rates higher and put upward pressure on bond yields in the Eurozone. However, since the start of the year, the increase in Bund yields is lower than expected based on the past statistical relationship. This probably reflects a conviction by investors that the ECB will start cutting its policy rate earlier than the Federal Reserve. This monetary desynchronisation is linked to a notable difference in terms of inflation with the US. Therefore, when the ECB signals that it will cut policy rates in the near term, markets are not surprised. What’s more, the message from the ECB is credible because it is underpinned by the view that monetary policy thus far has been successful in bringing and keeping inflation on a path towards its target. Successful disinflation thus cushions the impact of higher US Treasury yields on long-term interest rates in the Eurozone.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

The single operational indicator in the form of a net expenditure path should facilitate communication and emphasizes the key role of discretionary primary spending rather than tax increases in bringing public finances under control.

At the risk of oversimplifying, the question is whether fiscal policy should be based on an iron rule or a golden rule. The debt brake imposes fiscal discipline on future governments, which enhances fiscal policy credibility. However, its focus on the budget deficit implies that under realistic assumptions, public debt in percent of GDP will decline significantly. Proponents of the golden rule argue that, given the huge investment needs -green and digital transition, public support to innovation, etc.-, any leeway should be used to finance these investments, thereby enhancing structural growth and/or accelerating the green transition.

From a strictly economic point of view, dollarisation is effective in tackling hyperinflation. However, to be sustainable in the long term, it imposes severe constraints on fiscal policy and the nature of foreign investment.

This picture, nonetheless, conceals some imbalances most apparent in Brazil’s growth profile, the dynamics of unemployment and the structure of its trade balance. The markets’ renewed skepticism relative to the government's ability to balance its books (despite the new fiscal framework) constitutes another grey area.

The foreign exchange risk has been contained thanks to the support of foreign direct investment and external financing. Buoyant domestic demand has helped to offset the effects of the slowdown in Europe on exports. Inflationary pressures, which were still substantial in 2023, are expected to ease this year. In Croatia, macroeconomic risks will be reduced significantly thanks to the eurozone accession. However, its high dependency on tourism activity is still a factor of vulnerability. While Serbia’s admission to the EU is still being hindered by predominantly political factors, its economic performance has been strong, both in terms of external accounts and public finances.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com
Egypt: Rising pressure on public finances,"https://economic-research.bnpparibas.com/html/en-US/Egypt-Rising-pressure-public-finances-2/13/2024,49350","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0100","Against a backdrop of rising regional geopolitical pressures, the economic crisis is deepening further in Egypt and now poses a threat to public finances. With no agreement reached with the IMF, the balance of payments crisis is continuing to unfold, and the adjustments needed are being postponed. As a result of the exchange rate depreciating and interest rates rocketing, this crisis has pushed the interest burden on government debt to a level that could quickly become unsustainable. As a matter of fact, it could hit 70% of government revenue this year and remain very high next year. While reaching an agreement with the IMF should provide a solution for the balance of payments crisis, at least in the short term, the government restructuring domestic debt is becoming an increasingly likely scenario.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

External accounts held up fairly well in 2023, but the macroeconomic situation remains very fragile. Debt repayments for this year are significant, and the country is not immune from another shock. In particular, the prospect of rapprochement with the IMF seems less and less likely, fuelling fears about the government's ability to cover all its financing needs.

The peace agreement between the federal authorities and the Tigray rebel forces, signed in November 2022, ended two years of civil war and cleared the way for negotiations with international institutions to resume. Consequently, almost three years after requesting a debt restructuring under the G20 Common Framework, Ethiopia reached an agreement on an interim suspension of its bilateral debt service. However, this is only the first step on its journey, as the Ethiopian government must now reach agreements with all of its external creditors in order to fully restructure its debt. Before this, it must negotiate with the IMF in order to obtain its financial support, in exchange for undertaking tough reforms which will primarily set out to strengthen the country's external accounts. This is all happening against the backdrop of ongoing conflicts in the region, which are jeopardising the country’s relations with its international partners.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

However, the timing of the first cut remains uncertain, as does the number of expected cuts. Conditions for a first rate cut in June seem to be in place for the ECB, which, according to our forecasts, would thus act before the Fed, whose first rate cut is expected in July (instead of June previously). The possibility is rising that the Fed will not cut rates at all this year because of the resilience of growth and inflation. Such a prolonged Fed monetary status quo could have more negative than positive consequences.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

In this respect, the first quarter of 2024 was disappointing. On the other side of the balance of risks, economic activity is still buoyant and does not need the timetable to be accelerated. Thus, the event of a delayed and smaller decrease in the policy rate has gained credibility, and we are now forecasting two rate cuts in 2024, bringing the Fed Funds rate to 4.75-5.00% at the end of the year.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

However, the industrial sector in the eurozone is facing major structural problems, which will not (or will only slightly) be addressed by lowering the ECB’s policy rates. The ramp-up of the EU’s recovery fund should, in theory, enable southern eurozone countries, which are the main recipients, to outperform again in 2024. However, so far, its effects have been relatively limited and the implementation problems, as highlighted in a recent European Commission report, will not go away completely this year.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

The country might even be in recession again in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024. So has Germany bottomed out? From an economic point of view, this is likely because the moment of weakness, posted this winter, is partly due to exceptional effects. From a structural point of view, the German economy is expected to continue to post moderate growth, which would not allow it to regain its status as a driver of European growth.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

Although not in the same way as in previous years, headwinds affected the French economy in Q1 2024. Beyond this purely cyclical upturn, to return to more durable growth, we will need to wait for the return of French consumers, which we also expect to see in Q2.

The recovery of the economy was broad-based. Private consumption rose by 1.2% in 2023, benefitting from the further improvement in labour market conditions. In 2023, investment continued to be the main driver of the Italian recovery. Expenditures on machinery and ICT equipment were 20% higher than in 2019, with some first positive effects on Italian potential growth.

Household consumption, the main driver of growth, was buoyed by the strong labour market and slowing inflation. We are forecasting growth of 0.4% q/q in Q1 2024, before it accelerates in the subsequent quarters. Therefore, for the fourth year, Spanish growth is expected to be one of the Eurozone’s driving forces (2% y/y versus 0.7% y/y).",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

Inflation continues to cool down, even though it remains stickier than thought in some sectors. A new government has still not been formed yet, but there is a consensus about the fact that once it is the case, public spending is set to increase further, giving the economy an extra boost.

One-off factors temporarily sped up normalisation in both firm investment and international trade, but private consumption once again carries the brunt of economic growth. Consumption patterns are changing however, with more e-commerce and share of total outlays spent on services.

This shift in the political landscape, where no party now has an absolute majority in Portugal’s Parliament, could be a source of instability in the country. Nevertheless, the sweeping consolidation of public finances during António Costa’s term, as well as sound macroeconomic fundamentals, give the future government considerable economic and fiscal leeway. Portuguese growth is expected to remain well above Eurozone growth in 2024 (standing at 1.2%, according to the European Commission, compared to 0.7% for the Eurozone).",economic-research.bnpparibas.com

After a year 2023 marked by a gradual deterioration in activity (a slowdown in the first half of the year, followed by a contraction in the second half), GDP growth is expected to remain slightly positive in 2024. With the general election, scheduled to be held at the end of the year, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who is facing difficulties within the Conservative party, is struggling to reassure households who are bearing the full brunt of rising costs of living and interest rates. Despite a recovery in purchasing power and the resilience in the labour market, private consumption remains depressed. Nevertheless, the drop in inflation should lead to the start of monetary easing in June, which is expected to be modest, with a one-percent reduction (5.25% to 4.25%) expected in 2024.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com
