turning to a outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create.,rss.cnn.com,New York CNN Business — General Electric is turning to an outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create Larry Culp  is a proven leader known for his handson approach He received a hero’s welcome from Wall Street on Monday after suddenly being installed as GE’s new boss GE’s GE beatendown share price spiked  Culp who became CEO of industrial manufacturer Danaher at just  faces a monumental task in restoring GE to greatness The iconic maker of light bulbs MRI machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt Nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from GE’s market value over the past  years That’s roughly the size of Facebook FB GE a company that prides itself on management excellence is so desperate that for the first time in its year history it is being led by an outsider “GE has been like watching a slow but fatal train wreck” Scott Davis lead analyst at Melius Research wrote to clients on Monday “Unwinding  years of bad decisions will require courage” but Davis added “I wouldn’t want to bet against Larry” Culp brings credibility By bringing in fresh blood GE is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under John Flannery a year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as CEO to make room for Culp “GE should be commended for selecting a credible seasoned GE outsider” Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote to clients Culp is likely to “more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be” Culp built an impressive track record while leading Danaher between  and  The company’s revenue and market cap quintupled over that time It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited” Jeff Sonnenfeld Yale School of Management professor The Harvard Business School graduate is credited with remaking Danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses He pushed Danaher into health care a business that today sells tools lights and software used by dentists “He’s got the chops to take over a company of this size” said Jim Corridore an analyst who covers GE at CFRA Research ‘Disturbing’ writedown Khanna cheered Culp’s history of “prudent” capital allocation at Danaher noting that roughly  billion was deployed during his tenure After years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt GE sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources Analysts say that under former CEO Jeff Immelt GE far too often bought high and sold low Consider the disastrous  purchase of Alstom a  billion acquisition that pushed GE Power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time GE Power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to  billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired “The size of the writedown is disturbing” said Corridore Flannery took over a company in disarray when he became CEO last year While he deserves credited for disclosing “dirty laundry” he uncovered Flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders “It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited” said Jeff Sonnenfeld an authority on corporate governance at the Yale School of Management In a statement Immelt predicted that GE Power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent “Larry Culp will be a strong leader for GE and its board of directors His expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with GE’s needs” Immelt said Will GE continue its makeover Now Culp must decide whether to press forward with Flannery’s turnaround plan Culp joined GE’s board in April meaning he signed off on Flannery’s push to remake the company around power its booming aviation business and renewable energy The makeover would require GE to get rid of its health care railroad light bulb and oilandgas businesses  and use the proceeds to pay down debt Given Culp’s history in health care at Danaher Sonnenfeld predicted that GE could decide to keep its own health care division GE’s vast corporate structure built up over decades by Immelt and Welch could get slimmeddown under Culp Culp ran Danaher with less than  employees in the corporate office and Davis said the new CEO will likely likely “strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms” Tall challenge ahead But costcutting alone won’t fix GE Culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at GE Power Not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems GE also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates And then there’s the ghost of GE Capital the financial arm that nearly killed GE a decade ago during the financial crisis Culp will be charged with safely shrinking GE Capital while navigating landmines such as WMC Mortgage the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the Justice Department Elsewhere at GE Capital Culp needs to stabilize the longterm care insurance portfolio that suffered a  billion loss in January The news prompted an SEC investigation  the second GE is currently facing By hiring Culp GE may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on Wall Street But don’t be fooled righting the ship will take much longer

encouraged the audience to read the recent Congressional Budget Office reports on the nations fiscal condition Everyone should be reading the things that theyre publishing about the US budget deficit

interest rates bite Corporate executives this earnings season have lamented that customers are disinterested in shelling out on bigticket items for their bedrooms backyards and everywhere in between It comes at a pivotal moment for the national economy the average Joe has been contending with a doublewhammy of high prices and borrowing costs while economists and policymakers are trying to gauge the impact this has made This matters because it adds to a growing picture of consumer spending finally slowing down as experts long anticipated That means the Federal Reserve may get the sign its been waiting for that interest rate hikes have had their intended effects of tightening the economy which could be good news for investors and consumers The consumers purchasing power is limited Sleep Number CEO Shelly Ibach told analysts late last month As a result consumers continue to scrutinize their spending and make nearterm decisions based primarily on need price and perceived value And they are deferring higherticket durable purchases Ibach said the mattress industry is in a historic recession with sales likely to continue to decline after two already tough years The Minneapolisbased

preparing for — and in some cases seeing — a slowdown over the last several months Data from Prosper Insights  Analytics a partner of the National Retail Federation shows American adults have been increasingly delaying spending in areas like home improvement and electronics compared with before the pandemic Consumers are still spending but the sense that we get now is that theyre being a little bit more careful said Mark Mathews the NRFs executive director of research Theyre making important choices in terms of how they spend Theyre very very price sensitive and definitely we are back into a situation where consumers are all about the deal Multiple consumer headwinds A shopper on the fence about if they feel like an expensive purchase is within budget — likely a more ubiquitous feeling now with hot inflation — would previously lean on paying over a longer period of time by using credit But those options have fallen out of favor as interest rates rose Also more credit card bills are delinquent showing that the era of consumers being flush with cash from pandemic stimulus has come to an end US households are cumulatively more than  billion in debt after excess peaked above  trillion in August  according to data analyzed by the San Francisco Fed One research group saw credit card debt rising while the New York Fed reported that Americans collectively owe more than  trillion Consumers are usually faced with either high interest rates or inflation as the Fed typically increases borrowing levels when prices are rising faster than it deems healthy for the economy But at this moment annualized inflation though significantly off peak growth seen earlier in the pandemic is still well above the central banks goal of  Thats despite the Fed funds rate sitting

provide another signal that consumers arent keeping up as prices climb Economists are quick to note that what feels bad in the short term for consumers can actually have a silver lining in long run Shoppers feeling unable to pull the trigger on bigger purchases — especially when paired with trends like being more price conscious — can offer justification for the Fed that its put enough pressure on the economy to bring inflation under control and clear the way to start lowering rates Theres a few other factors at play according to Mathews of the retail industry trade group The pandemic had a pullforward effect he explained Consumers snapped up goods meant to last several years while they were stuck at home during the shutdowns This may still be unwinding And with a greater focus on value shoppers may wait until Memorial Day or other periods ripe with deals Mathews said Not the right moment Finally a lot of these bigticket items are also connected in one way or another to people moving

depending on income level.,search.cnbc.com,In this article GRMN TSN AXP UPST Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Getty Images At American Express  consumers are continuing to open highfee credit cards and splurge on luxuries like travel But for lending firm Upstart  theres a strong interest in microloans as cashstrapped Americans try to scrape by That juxtaposition underscores the growing picture of bifurcation among income brackets in America And adds to an increasingly popular view that the US is experiencing a Kshaped recovery since the end of the pandemic where higher income classes reap the most benefits and lowerincome Americans tread water or fall behind Its led to a confusing picture of the US economy that can impact everything from how the Federal Reserve will move interest rates next to who Americans will vote for in November On top of this some are worried it will threaten the surprisingly resilient economy that has been a worldwide marvel And it comes at a unique moment with consumers once against leaning on debt and many beginning to crack Our consumers are doing really well American Express CFO Christophe Le Caillec told CNBC last month citing spending on flights and dinning out Theyre enjoying life for sure American Express typical consumer is affluent and is showing every sign that they are chugging along in the face of stubborn inflation and lingering economic uncertainty More than  million new credit cards — which sometimes carry annual fees costing up to hundreds of dollars — were issued in the latest quarter US cardholders as a whole spent  more in the most recent threemonth period Firstquarter airline spending on American Express cards climbed  from the prior quarter underscoring a continued willingness to pay for experiences Firstclass travel has exhibited special strength though management noted that can be tied in part to a resurgence of business trips That too may be a good sign for whitecollar workers as it shows businesses are willing to spend on travel again But behavior among some Upstart customers paints a different picture of the same economy The company on Tuesday reported an  surge in originations of loans of up to  during the first quarter These relief loans as management describes them have been used for expenses like rent and other regular bills according to principal product manager Blair Lanier People taking these loans are more likely to be lowerincome with no more than a high school diploma Lanier said Some may be turning to these small loans after being rejected for larger sums or by other lenders but Upstart has also made changes to its automatic approval processes the company said These loans are fixedfee products with an annual percentage rate up to  The last two years have been a very sort of unique and specific and unusual event in the macroeconomy Lanier said Im not that surprised that there is both significant existing demand for a product like this and that that demand would be visible right now Struggling lower tier Americans like those turning to Upstarts microloans are buckling under mounting financial pressures The end of Covidera fiscal stimulus along with the resumption of student loan payments have sapped the savings accumulated early in the pandemic Rising gas costs can be particularly painful for those without remote work privileges On the other hand higherincome consumers also may feel emboldened by rising home prices and strength in the stock market Lowerincome households account for a large chunk of the countrys population which can help explain the sour economic sentiment seen broadly The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index declined more than  between April and May alone as consumer expectations for future inflation rose according to data released Friday While the index came in far below economists forecasts it was still well above where it sat at the same time a year prior Some economists were at a loss to explain the change in the closely watched survey but it comes at a time when many have seen rainy day funds dry up Excess savings among Americans peaked above  trillion in August  according to data analyzed by the San Francisco Federal Reserve But that padding has been entirely depleted in the ensuing years as financial strain has grown with US households now cumulatively  billion in debt as of March At the same time costs for a variety of goods and services have risen Though the pace of inflation has cooled from multidecade highs seen in recent years prices continue to increase at a faster rate than monetary policymakers deem healthy for the economy Given these factors economists have been puzzled by a continued propensity to spend But the longawaited consumer slowdown is finally showing in a host of households brands particularly those frequented by lowerincome brackets McDonalds said it is adopting a streetfighting mentality and is laser focused on value after higher prices pushed away diners with less to spend Soda and snack producer PepsiCo acknowledged that the lowincome American is stretched Tyson Foods frozen chicken products Daniel Acker  Bloomberg  Getty Images Frozen food maker Tyson Foods has seen consumers shifting more to eating at home than the quickservice restaurants it supplies Management said the lower tax brackets in particular have switched to private labels from Tysons name brand when grocery shopping Thats part of a trend known as trading down that can indicate consumers are tightening purse strings Market data provider Adobe Analytics has seen this behavior online over the past four months across numerous categories including personal care electronics apparel furniture and groceries Furniture ecommerce platform Wayfair said that sales of bigticket items have been particularly weak Tool maker Stanley Black  Decker lamented soft consumption trends and interest in doityourself projects A hot labor market and rising wages have been pointed to as a source of optimism among this consumer base despite growing uncertainty elsewhere But last months shockingly weak jobs report and a recent jump in unemployment claims can throw some cold water on one of the last reasons for lowerincome Americans to feel good about the economy Were seeing a much more cautious lowincome consumer Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser told CNBCs Sara Eisen this week Theyre feeling more of the pressure of the cost of living which has been high and increased for them So while there is employment for them debt servicing levels are higher than they were before Fraser is one of several corporate leaders and economists pointing to the K shape of consumer habits In this environment the upper crust continues to spend while those less welloff now grapple with elevated price tags and interest rates watch now Put differently middle and highincome consumers are sanguine while lowincome consumer confidence is in recessionary territory according to Nancy Lazar chief global economist at Piper Sandler She said this discrepancy can dash hopes for a soft landing which is a goal outcome where inflation is tamed without tipping the economy into a period of prolonged contraction Its also important to remember that lowerincome Americans were feeling financial pressures before the pandemic said Tyler Schipper an associate professor of economics at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota While the group had made up ground amid the worker shortage he said a return to more troubled waters makes sense as the economy continues unraveling from the  shock They were starting from a place of struggling Schipper said This idea that lowerincome workers are going to be looking for the best prices I think is in some sense a return to normalcy Schipper said evidence of price matching or trading down can be good news for the Federal Reserve which is looking for signs that previously interest rate hikes have had their intended effects of tightening the economy Upper class hums along Higher earners though a smaller segment of the population remain on a tear and it could make all the difference for some companies

Chairman Jerome Powell prepares to testify before the Senate Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on March   Kent Nishimura  Getty Images News  Getty Images Faced with stubborn inflation that has raised concerns about where policy is headed the Federal Reserve has been ensnared in a holding pattern that likely will be reflected when it closes its meeting Wednesday Markets are anticipating a nearzero chance that the Federal Open Market Committee the central banks policysetting arm will announce any change to interest rates That will keep the Feds key overnight borrowing rate in a range targeted between  for what could be months — or even longer Recent commentary from policymakers and on Wall Street indicates theres not much else the committee can do at this point Pretty much everybody on the FOMC is talking from the same script right now said Guy LeBas chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott With maybe one or two exceptions policymakers pretty universally agree that the last few months of inflation data are too warm to justify action in the near term But theyre still hopeful that they will be in a position to cut rates later The only piece of news likely to come out of the meeting itself is an announcement that the Fed soon will reduce the level at which it is running down the bond holdings on its balance sheet before bringing an end to a process known as quantitative tightening altogether Outside of that the focus will be on rates and the central banks unwillingness to budge for now Read Why the Fed keeping rates higher for longer may not be such a bad thing Lack of confidence Officials from Chair Jerome Powell on down through the regional Fed bank presidents have said they dont expect to start cutting rates until they are more confident that inflation is headed in the right direction and back toward the  annual goal Powell surprised markets two weeks ago with tough talk on how committed he and his colleagues are to achieve that mandate Weve said at the FOMC that well need greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards  before it will be appropriate to ease policy he said at a central bank conference The recent data have clearly not given us greater confidence and instead indicate that its likely to take longer than expected to achieve that confidence Markets actually have held up pretty well since Powell made those comments on April  though stocks sold off Tuesday ahead of the meeting The Dow Jones Industrial Average had even gained  over that period with investors seemingly willing to live with the prospect of a higherforlonger rate climate watch now But theres always the specter that an unknown could come up That likely wont happen during the business portion of the FOMC meeting as most observers think the committee statement will show little or no change from March Yet Powell has been known to surprise markets in the past and his comments at the press conference will be scrutinized for just how hawkish of a view committee members hold I doubt were going to get something that really surprises market pricing LeBas said Powells comments were pretty clear that we have not yet reached the threshold for significant further evidence of cooling inflation he said Theres been plenty of data lately to back up that position The personal consumption expenditures price index released last week showed inflation running at a  annual rate when including all items or  for the allimportant core measure that excludes food and energy Fed officials prefer the Commerce Department index as a better inflation measure and focus more on core as a better indicator of longterm trends Additional evidence came Tuesday when the Labor Department said its employment cost index rose  in the first quarter a  percentage point gain from the previous period and ahead of the Wall Street outlook for  None of those numbers are consistent with the Feds goal and likely will push Powell to exercise caution about where policy goes from here with an emphasis on the fading outlook for rate cuts anytime soon Down to one cut hopes for more Futures market pricing sees only about a  chance of a rate cut as early as September and is now anticipating just one quarterpercentagepoint reduction by the end of  according to the CME Groups muchviewed FedWatch measure Some on Wall Street though are still hopeful that inflation data will show progress and allow the central bank to cut While the recent upside inflation surprise has narrowed the path for the FOMC to cut this year we expect upcoming inflation reports to be softer and still expect cuts in July and November though even moderate upside surprises could delay cuts further Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle said in a note The Wall Street banks economists are preparing for the possibility that the Fed could be on hold for longer particularly if inflation continues to surprise to the upside In addition they said the prospect of higher tariffs following the presidential election — favored by former President Donald Trump the Republican nominee — could be inflationary On top of that Goldman is part of a growing chorus on the Street that thinks the Feds March projection for the longrun neutral interest rate — neither stimulative nor restrictive — is too low at  However the firm also doesnt see rate hikes coming We continue to think that rate hikes are quite unlikely because there are no signs of genuine reheating at the moment and the funds rate is already quite elevated Mericle said It would probably take either a

took decades to create Larry Culp  is a proven leader known for his handson approach He received a hero’s welcome from Wall Street on Monday after suddenly being installed as GE’s new boss GE’s GE beatendown share price spiked  Culp who became CEO of industrial manufacturer Danaher at just  faces a monumental task in restoring GE to greatness The iconic maker of light bulbs MRI machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt Nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from GE’s market value over the past  years That’s roughly the size of Facebook FB GE a company that prides itself on management excellence is so desperate that for the first time in its year history it is being led by an outsider “GE has been like watching a slow but fatal train wreck” Scott Davis lead analyst at Melius Research wrote to clients on Monday “Unwinding  years of bad decisions will require courage” but Davis added “I wouldn’t want to bet against Larry” Culp brings credibility By bringing in fresh blood GE is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under John Flannery a year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as CEO to make room for Culp “GE should be commended for selecting a credible seasoned GE outsider” Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote to clients Culp is likely to “more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be” Culp built an impressive track record while leading Danaher between  and  The company’s revenue and market cap quintupled over that time It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited” Jeff Sonnenfeld Yale School of Management professor The Harvard Business School graduate is credited with remaking Danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses He pushed Danaher into health care a business that today sells tools lights and software used by dentists “He’s got the chops to take over a company of this size” said Jim Corridore an analyst who covers GE at CFRA Research ‘Disturbing’ writedown Khanna cheered Culp’s history of “prudent” capital allocation at Danaher noting that roughly  billion was deployed during his tenure After years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt GE sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources Analysts say that under former CEO Jeff Immelt GE far too often bought high and sold low Consider the disastrous  purchase of Alstom a  billion acquisition that pushed GE Power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time GE Power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to  billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired “The size of the writedown is disturbing” said Corridore Flannery took over a company in disarray when he became CEO last year While he deserves credited for disclosing “dirty laundry” he uncovered Flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders “It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited” said Jeff Sonnenfeld an authority on corporate governance at the Yale School of Management In a statement Immelt predicted that GE Power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent “Larry Culp will be a strong leader for GE and its board of directors His expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with GE’s needs” Immelt said Will GE continue its makeover Now Culp must decide whether to press forward with Flannery’s turnaround plan Culp joined GE’s board in April meaning he signed off on Flannery’s push to remake the company around power its booming aviation business and renewable energy The makeover would require GE to get rid of its health care railroad light bulb and oilandgas businesses  and use the proceeds to pay down debt Given Culp’s history in health care at Danaher Sonnenfeld predicted that GE could decide to keep its own health care division GE’s vast corporate structure built up over decades by Immelt and Welch could get slimmeddown under Culp Culp ran Danaher with less than  employees in the corporate office and Davis said the new CEO will likely likely “strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms” Tall challenge ahead But costcutting alone won’t fix GE Culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at GE Power Not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems GE also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates And then there’s the ghost of GE Capital the financial arm that nearly killed GE a decade ago during the financial crisis Culp will be charged with safely shrinking GE Capital while navigating landmines such as WMC Mortgage the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the Justice Department Elsewhere at GE Capital Culp needs to stabilize the longterm care insurance portfolio that suffered a  billion loss in January The news prompted an SEC investigation  the second GE is currently facing By hiring Culp GE may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on Wall Street But don’t be fooled righting the ship will take much longer

EDT",The implosion of Lehman Brothers -- and the mayhem it unleashed -- was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression.,rss.cnn.com,Editor’s Note This story originally published on September   New York CNN Business — Legendary investment bank Lehman Brothers was on fire — and no one was coming to put it out Bank of America refused to rescue the yearold Wall Street firm without support from Uncle Sam The British government wouldn’t let Barclays BCS buy Lehman Brothers and its toxic balance sheet And Washington decided against another politically unpopular bailout So Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail At  am on Monday September   Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter  bankruptcy protection What ensued was the largest and most complex bankruptcy in American history But that doesn’t do justice to the damage Lehman’s demise caused the financial system The implosion of Lehman Brothers — and the mayhem it unleashed — was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression “It was the moment when the financial crisis fully burst upon us when panic seized the markets” Phil Angelides who led the official bipartisan inquiry into the  meltdown told CNN Lehman’s failure shook Wall Street to its core The Dow plummeted  points the equivalent of  points today Some  billion vanished from retirement plans and other investment funds The panic that followed plunged the American economy into a severe downturn now known as the Great Recession Today Lehman Brothers and its CEO Dick Fuld are the poster children for the reckless risktaking that wrecked the economy getty imagesCNN Frantic talks Lehman’s final days were marked by frantic lastminute negotiations over its fate Right up until the end everyone thought someone would rescue Lehman Brothers Surely the firm wouldn’t be allowed to fail Bear Stearns a smaller investment bank had been saved just six months earlier by Washington and JPMorgan Chase On Wednesday September  South Korea’s Korean Development Bank dropped out of the running to be Lehman Brothers’ white knight The news — combined with Lehman’s announcement of a record  billion quarterly loss — sent the bank’s shares cratering  With South Korea out Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to ask him to find a creative way to buy Lehman Brothers Put on your “imagination hat” Paulson urged Lewis But by Friday September  Bank of America said it was bowing out unless the government was willing to help Lehman was simply stuck with too many “illiquid” mortgage assets and it couldn’t sell them quickly enough to meet other obligations Bank of America decided instead to buy the next investment bank in line to fail Merrill Lynch “You just didn’t know what was going to happen when you got into work on Monday” said Brady Kim who worked as an analyst on Lehman’s trading desk “Were you going to be working for Barclays Some Korean conglomerate” The one option few saw coming was bankruptcy “They’re not just going to let the bank go under” Kim said ‘Not a penny’ That Friday evening Paulson ordered the heads of the big Wall Street firms to meet at the New York Fed’s headquarters They were told to come up with a privatesector solution to save Lehman American officials had little appetite for another bailout They had just seized control of teetering mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the weekend before Fed officials said Paulson made it clear there would be no government help this time “not a penny” Saturday brought an apparent breakthrough for Lehman Barclays agreed to buy Lehman — as long as Wall Street would take some assets off its hands But the Barclays deal went up in smoke on Sunday when UK regulators balked at blessing the risky deal I never thought the company would go out of business” James Chico former Lehman Brothers analyst “Imagine if I said yes to a British bank buying a very large American bank which  collapsed the following week” Alistair Darling the UK’s chancellor of the exchequer later told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission ‘It was pandemonium up there’ With no buyers left regulators pressured Lehman Brothers to file for bankruptcy on Sunday night before trading opened in the morning Lehman’s lawyers and executives left the New York Fed to inform the board that no rescue was coming “We went back to the headquarters and it was pandemonium up there” Harvey Miller the bankruptcy counselor for Lehman Brothers later told investigators The Fed rejected a lastminute Lehman plea for additional assistance from the central bank leading to the earlymorning bankruptcy The collapse shocked employees “I never thought the company would go out of business It was terrible” said James Chico who worked as an analyst in the back office at Lehman for more than two decades Tom Rogers was on his honeymoon in St Lucia when the bank his employer for seven years went bust “I came back and it was just mass chaos” said Rogers who started as an intern at Lehman and moved up to senior analyst in the firm’s reinsurance business ‘Cataclysmic proportions’ The turmoil showed just how fragile and interconnected the entire system was The situation was exacerbated by the nearcollapse of AIG the insurance behemoth Regulators feared AIG’s demise would bring down the whole system — so AIG was given a  billion bailout Fear and panic quickly spread through the financial system causing credit markets to freeze Even large and iconic industrial companies such as General Motors were unable to receive shortterm funding “The financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of Lehman Brothers” the crisis inquiry commission concluded Fuld who had infamously told shareholders in April  that “the worst is behind us” emerged as one of the villains of the crisis He steered Lehman right into the face of an epic storm Between  and  Lehman’s assets had more than tripled to  billion And its borrowing ratio known as leverage jumped to  times its shareholders’ equity in the company The firm had relatively little capital to protect against trouble Madelyn Antoncic Lehman’s chief risk officer from  to  tried and failed to warn Fuld against taking on more mortgage risk “At the senior level they were trying to push so hard that the wheels started to come off” Antoncic told the commission For his part Fuld told lawmakers in  that the pain of Lehman’s failure “will stay with me for the rest of my life” The former Lehman Brothers boss who made and lost a  billion fortune on Wall Street has made few public appearances since the crisis He did speak at a  event where he admitted he would do some things differently “I missed the violence of the market and how it spread from one asset class to the next” Fuld said Richard Fuld former chairman and chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers speaks during a hearing in  Andrew HarrerBloombergGetty Images Where were the regulators Fuld doesn’t deserve all the blame The firm’s demise underscored the wild risktaking that regulators and CEOs had allowed to become rampant across Wall Street Consider for example the  deregulation of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives Regulators had little window into how these trades linked banks to one another When one bank failed other financial institutions fell in a kind of domino effect Even a month before Lehman’s bankruptcy officials at the Fed were still seeking information on the bank’s  derivative contracts And they were clueless about the risk posed by AIG’s enormous book of derivatives “The people charged with overseeing our financial system were flying blind as the crisis developed” Angelides said Only in  with the passage of the sweeping DoddFrank financial reform law were derivatives required to be bought and sold on exchanges Regulators also failed to get Lehman Brothers to slow its headfirst dive into mortgages The firm kept buying real estate assets well into the first quarter of  The Treasury Department’s Office of Thrift Supervision didn’t issue a report warning of Lehman’s “outsized bet” on commercial real estate until two months before its collapse The OTS was abolished by DoddFrank Likewise the SEC declined to call Lehman Brothers out for exceeding risk limits — even though the agency was aware “Our regulatory system is made of humans — and humans make mistakes” James Angel Georgetown University business professor “The SECknew of the firm’s disregard of risk management” the commission said Lehman Brothers also got away with using accounting gimmicks to mask how much money it borrowed Bart McDade Lehman’s president and chief operating officer wrote in an email at the time that the accounting maneuvers are “another drug we R on” Should Lehman have been saved Economists will debate for decades whether Washington should have rescued Lehman to prevent the chaos that followed Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke maintains that regulators had no authority to lend to a failing Lehman “We essentially had no choice and had to let it fail” Bernanke told the commission But others say Bernanke and Paulson should have realized that allowing Lehman to fail would deepen the crisis “Our regulatory system is made of humans — and humans make mistakes” said James Angel a business professor at Georgetown University “The Fed clearly could have done a better job of containing the damage” The inconsistent response by Washington — deciding not to rescue Lehman after saving Bear and before helping AIG — “added to uncertainty and panic” the financial crisis inquiry concluded Could it happen again Today’s financial system is safer thanks to the reforms put in place after  Banks have bulked up on vast amounts of capital Regulators are more vigilant But some worry about the risk of another downturn even if it doesn’t start with banks “I’m concerned about now” said famed Yale professor Robert Schiller pointing to “highly priced” stocks and rising home values “We’re already in for what could be a repeat of ” Shiller said “It will look different this time but there could be a decline in home prices and recession coming in” Let’s hope the lessons from the last crisis haven’t been forgotten A Decade Later It’s been  years since the financial crisis rocked America’s economy

Janet Yellen and the Fed may deserve more of the credit for the market's move.,rss.cnn.com,The Dow SP  Nasdaq and Russell  each hit new alltime highs Monday Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the US will continue to thrive So is this the Donald Trump rally Or the Janet Yellen rally Some strategists believe Trumps stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead You could argue that POTUS  has dealt POTUS  a pretty good hand The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident But investors and financial journalists are often quick to give the president more credit  and blame  than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday one that was aptly titled Message to Market Its Not All About Donald Related Trump isnt killing the bull market Golub noted that the SP  rose nearly  from late June through Election Day  a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president But stocks have continued to rally since then rising another  since Trump pulled off the upset at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street victory You cant have it both ways It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didnt lose Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress Yet Golub points out that the yield on the year US Treasury was going up during the late summer as well Of course many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too Yet once again many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected but was happening because many thought he would lose Related Stocks have avoided a  dive for an unusually long period of time So its odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win Whats really going on The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve Yes the markets are reacting to Washington But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen not the White House The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in  regardless of who won the race for president The good news for investors is that the US economy seems to be growing steadily but does not appear to be at risk of overheating Related Heres why the worlds largest money manager is worried The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of  annually But thats not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time That would push the Feds key shortterm rate to a range of  to  Thats still extremely low At those levels stocks would still be more attractive than bonds Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip And consumers would probably keep spending So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president With that in mind Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead  or stopping it dead in its tracks

"America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico",http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/13/news/economy/nafta-canada-trudeau-trump-mexico/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Mon, 13 Feb 2017 11:59:43 EST",President-elect Donald Trump focuses his criticism of NAFTA on Mexico. But Canada and America have a rocky trade history too.,rss.cnn.com,America and Canada have one of the worlds biggest trade relationships President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canadas Prime Minister Justin Trudeau We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada Trump said at the news conference But the USCanada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think There have been trade wars acts of retaliation allegations of dumping and jobs lost Our trading relationship obviously is strongbut the relationship has been rocky despite the agreements we have in place says Stuart Trew an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives a research group in Ottawa Canadas capital Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA the trade agreement between the US Mexico and Canada But Canada is rarely mentioned Yet there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada  almost all by US companies  than against Mexico Even today Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau  Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico Listening to Trump you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA But since NAFTAs inception in  there have been  complaints brought against Canada almost all by US companies Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico Canada or the US Theres only been  complaints against Mexico By comparison companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of  complaints against the US And increasingly Canada is the target of American complaints Since  Canada has been hit with  of the NAFTA dispute claims according to CCPA a Canadian research firm  The US  Canada lumber battle NAFTA isnt the only sore area In  the US slapped a roughly  tariff on Canadian lumber alleging that Canada was dumping its wood on the US market Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies  jobs It was a very sour point in Canadian  American relations for quite a while says Tom Velk an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal The dispute had its origins in the s when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts werent playing fair Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada American lumber companies still allege that it does and a US Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in  It didnt say whether the subsidies were ongoing According to the allegations Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from That subsidy  on top of Canadas huge lumber supply  allowed Canada to price its lumber below what US companies can charge The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada denying Americas claim and the two sides came to an agreement in  to end the tariff However that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October and the two sides are back at it again The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldnt reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with US lumber companies calling once again for tariffs Related Without NAFTA wed be out of business  SmootHawley triggers US  Canada trade war Things got even worse during the Great Depression In  Congress wanted to protect US jobs from global trade So the US slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers It was called the SmootHawley Act Today it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was Canada was furious and retaliated more than any other country against the US sparking a trade war Canada was so incensed thatthey raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new US tariff according to Doug Irwin a Dartmouth Professor and author of Peddling Protectionism SmootHawley and the Great Depression For example the US increased a tariff on eggs from  cents to  cents these are s prices after all Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from  cents to  cents  a threefold increase Exports dwindled sharply in  the US exported nearly  eggs to Canada Three years later it only shipped about  eggs according to Irwin Related Remember SmootHawley Americas last major trade war  Canadas sky high tariffs on US eggs poultry milk Fast forward to today SmootHawley is long gone but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on US imports of eggs chicken and milk For instance some tariffs on eggs are as high as  per dozen according to Canadas Agriculture Department Some milk imports depending on the fat content are as high as  Theyre so onerous that you cant bring it across Theres no American eggs in Quebec says Velk According to Canadas Embassy in the US reality is much different Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk poultry and eggs The US does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries but they are not nearly as high as Canadas Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some US dairy and poultry farmers some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now Related Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about  COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA Despite all these disputes experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world In fact the two countries are so interconnected now when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against US lawmakers For example Canadian meat producers disputed a US law that required them to label where the cattle was born raised and slaughtered Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the US and took the case to the WTO The WTO sided with Canada and last December Congress repealed the countryoforiginlabeling law American meat producers  whose business is intertwined with Canada  actually supported their counterparts in Canada arguing the regulation was too burdensome As for Trumps proposal of tearing up NAFTA many American and Canadian experts say that its not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth Editors note This

Visa crackdown puts these rural doctors at risk,http://money.cnn.com/2017/02/10/news/economy/visa-ban-rural-doctor-shortage/index.html?section=money_news_international,"Fri, 10 Feb 2017 20:02:55 EST",Read full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,At his pediatrics practice in Sioux Falls South Dakota Dr Alaa Al Nofal sees up to  patients a day Hes known some of them since they were born Others he still treats after theyve graduated from high school I treat these children for Type  diabetes thyroid problems thyroid cancer puberty disorders and adrenal gland diseases he said Al Nofals expertise is critical He is one of just five fulltime pediatric endocrinologists in a  squaremile area that covers both South and North Dakota Like most of rural America its a region plagued by a shortage of doctors Were very lucky to have Dr Al Nofal here We cant afford to lose someone with his specialization said Cindy Morrison chief marketing officer for Sanford Health a nonprofit health care system based in Sioux Falls that runs  hospitals and clinics in predominantly rural communities Related Visa ban could make doctor shortage in rural America even worse Yet Sanford Health may lose Al Nofal and several other doctors who are crucial to its health care network A Syrian citizen Al Nofal is in Sioux Falls through a special workforce development program called the Conrad  visa waiver  which basically waives the requirement that doctors who complete their residency on a J exchange visitor visa must return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another American visa The Conrad  waiver allows him to stay in the US for a maximum of three years as long as he commits to practicing in an area where there is a doctor shortage After President Donald Trump issued a temporary immigration ban restricting people from seven Muslimmajority countries  including Syria  from entering the US Al Nofal is unsure about his future in America We agree that something more has to be done to protect the country but this executive order will have a negative effect on physicians from these countries who are badly needed across America said Al Nofal They may no longer want to practice in the United States The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban Related Trump furious after court upholds block on travel ban Over the last  years the Conrad  visa waiver has funneled  foreign physicians into underserved communities Sanford Health has  physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order If we lost Dr Al Nofal and our other J physicians we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families said Sanford Healths Morrison And the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors too The Conrad  visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J nonimmigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the US More than  medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in US residency programs through J visas About  of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban according to the American Association of Medical Colleges J visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the US and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place The State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of national interest but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration The stress and concern generated by the shortterm executive order could have longterm implications with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas said Dr Larry Dial vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall Universitys school of medicine in Huntington West Virginia Related Obamacares impact on this Alaska town with only one doctors office Al Nofal went to medical school in Damascus Syrias capital and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J visa He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J waiver which placed him in Sioux Falls Nineteen months into his threeyear commitment Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than  pediatric patients a month on average He sees most of his patients at the Sanford Childrens Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls where families often drive hours for an appointment Once a month he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen about  miles away Its not easy being a doctor in this setting said Al Nofal citing the long hours and South Dakotas famously frigid winters But as a physician Im trained to help people whatever the circumstances and Im proud of it Its one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban I have a month old baby and I cant travel to Syria now My family in Syria cant come here he said Now my family cant meet their first grandson I know if we leave I probably can never come back he said Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now Im afraid of how I will be treated he said Hes also afraid he will be stopped at the airport  even if hes traveling to another state Related Trump travel ban and what you need to know Almatmed Abdelsalam whos from Benghazi Libya had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon Georgia through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Floridas College of Medicine in July Everything was going smoothly Abdelsalam who treats hospital patients and veterans applied for the visa waiver and was accepted He signed an employment contract with Magna Care which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself his wife and their two young kids over the summer But there was one last step For his J waiver application to be fully completed it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services The executive order came in the middle of that process stalling my application at the State Department he said Because hes a Libyan citizen Libya is also subject to the visa ban Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors Even though theyve hired me Im not sure how long they can wait for me he said No one can argue its necessary to keep the country safe but we should also keep the country healthy he said Doctors like me trained in the US at some of the best schools are an asset not a liability

Wellcoaches’ curriculum and instructors Wellcoaches is one of the leaders when it comes to the health coach curriculum The organization’s textbook Coaching Psychology Manual is the guiding course material not only for Wellcoaches’ programming but also by other organizations offering health coach certifications as well as university classrooms In fact the University of North Texas’s master’s in lifestyle health sciences and coaching integrates Wellcoaches’ modules one through four directly into its program Jackson says overall the curriculum is constantly being updated with new and relevant ideas Plus the development of the third edition of the manual is in the works Preparation materials for each live lesson can also be downloaded allowing students to learn on the go All of Wellcoaches’ faculty are NBHWC certified—and many have advanced degrees and years of experience in health coaching Additionally Wellcoaches utilizes a team of medical and research advisors to guide its curriculum development The second edition of the Coaching Psychology Manual used as part of the Wellcoaches certification curriculum Finally Wellcoaches also notably updates a job board for students to find opportunities especially those that desire those with a Wellcoaches certification Wellcoaches’s transparency The team at Wellcoaches is accessible and encourages individuals to pick the health coach certification program—if that’s the route they are heading down—that’s best for one’s own goals If there are questions that are not answered on its website Wellcoaches provides accessible email and phone number contacts to its team Fortune received sameday responses to inquiries For prospective students the organization hosts occasional information sessions where individuals can ask questions directly Oneonone meetings are also an option The primary audience of Wellcoaches has transformed over the years Jackson explains while in the early years fitness professionals were largely enrolling in the programs they’ve seen an increase in physicians and nurses Overall students are across the age spectrum—from  to  years old—and differ largely in terms of career goals whether that’s starting their own practice working in a corporate office or working in a clinical setting At the end of each live lesson the program requires students to complete a feedback survey in order for students to reflect on their learning and allow Wellcoaches to improve their teaching Wellcoaches’s student experience and outcomes Cathy Dunford is a Wellcoaches alum—of both its core and advanced training programs—and the founder of her own practice TrueCoachingU She was impressed by Wellcoaches because of its customer services affordability and thorough curriculum She initially enrolled in a different health coach certification at a different organization paying two to three times more and learned little about real coaching “Wellcoaches taught me real tools to put in my coaching toolbox—like motivational interviewing appreciative inquiry nonviolent communication internal family systems I use a lot of that all day every day” Dunford says The instructors at Wellcoaches Dunford says were also a major part of what made the experience life changing—not only are they knowledgeable in the field but they also made learning interesting The one piece of advice she wished she had known before starting out in the health coach education world is to start by looking through the NBHWCapproved training program list which she says is an easy way to make sure its reputable and potentially worth the investment For Iris Fernndez Valdz attending Wellcoaches was a major career change After studying computer science at Brown University she decided to shift to health coaching and later found Abetter Way an organization at the intersection of justice and coaching “They wrote the Bible on health and wellness coaches that everyone uses to study for the board exam So I was like let’s go to the source” Valdz says After also engaging in the core and advanced training programs she says Wellcoaches was a transformative experience and led to profound personal growth One of the most important skills Valdez says they learned was listening skills—both how to listen to others as well as oneself “Wellcoaches really has always had that heart about what it means to be and to hold presence as a coach” Valdz explains Is Wellcoaches’s health coach certification worth it For those that are interested in applying health coach practices into their lives—whether it be as part of an existing career or as part of a new journey in the health and wellness world Wellcoaches is a very safe choice Not only is it on the more affordable side of things when it comes to cost but the program has figured out how to well balance flexible and engaging learning There are live class sessions allowing students to build human connections with their instructors peers and the content as well as ask questions on the spot Students also have selfpaced materials to work with and the leaders at Wellcoaches have proven their willingness to work with students and be transparent Wellcoaches is also very widely known and respected in the health coach space It should say a lot that the founder of Wellcoaches Margaret Moore also is a cofounder of the NBHWC moreover their thorough textbook curriculum is not only utilized by Wellcoaches itself but also other certification programs and college classrooms Check out all of Fortune’s rankings of degree programs and learn more about specific career paths
Investors clash over Elon Musk’s $46 billion pay package: 'The board has yet to ensure that Tesla has a full-time CEO',https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/tesla-elon-musk-pay-compensation-plan-investors-clash/,"Tue, 21 May 2024 21:17:39 +0000",Investors say Musk is spread too thin among his other companies to justify such high pay.,fortune.com,Tesla investors are lobbying to shoot down the largest moonshot compensation plan in history A group including the New York City pension funds filed a notice on Monday urging others to vote against Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s  billion stockoption package at the company’s shareholder meeting on June  New York City Comptroller Brad Lander who serves as investment advisor to the city’s funds with  billion in assets is marshaling the charge According to the letter he signed the Tesla board is “overly beholden” to Musk and hasn’t bothered to step in when Musk ignores Tesla to focus on his roles at the Boring Company Neuralink SpaceX X and other companies The investors complained about Musk splitting his time between the companies by focusing on one company per day “The board has yet to ensure that Tesla has a fulltime CEO” investors said Meanwhile he’s siphoning key talent away from Tesla “More recently Musk has begun poaching top engineers from Tesla’s AI and autonomy team for his new company xAI including Ethan Knight who was computer vision chief at Tesla” the investor letter said The notice has the makings of a showdown next month between some of Tesla’s pension fund investors who believe they’re overpaying for a parttime CEO and the EV maker’s base of individual retail investors who see Musk as a visionary leader who must remain at Tesla at all costs At stake is a shareholder vote to ratify Musk’s pay plan now valued at about  billion after it was rescinded by a judge in January Tesla proposed the pay plan a second time in the spring and has thrown its support behind the proposal Musk has rallied the retail base of support with tweets thanking them for voting and Tesla’s own ads promoting a vote in favor of Musk’s pay plan Since April  Tesla has notified investors  separate times that Musk has tweeted about the meeting or that it has updated its website devoted to the vote titled “Protecting Your Investment and Tesla’s Future” According to the dissident investors which include Amalgamated Bank AkademikerPension and SOC Investment Group Musk represents a key risk to stock values because he has pledged a portion of his  stake in Tesla as collateral for loans “If Musk were ever forced to sell his pledged stock it could lead to a massive drop in stock price to the detriment of shareholders” the investor letter said Plus the handsoff nature of the board means Musk treats Tesla “as a coffer” for himself and his other businesses the investors argue Musk has admitted to using Tesla engineers to work on issues at X formerly Twitter and defended himself by saying that “no Tesla board member had stopped him from using Tesla staff for his other businesses” according to the letter Those “distractions” have played a material role in Tesla’s underperformance relative to the SP  General Motors and Ford investors said The Tesla board begs to differ however The website Tesla set up to support its payratification vote features voting instructions and other information about the shareholder meeting including a video with independent board chair Robyn Denholm In it Denholm said Musk’s comp plan was set up a decade ago with targets so “farfetched so extraordinarily ambitious that skeptics called them laughingly impossible” “If he failed Elon was entitled to receive no salary no cash bonuses and no equity” said Denholm “But if Elon was able to make it happen you and all other stockholders would reap the benefits The award worked” In half the time Musk grew revenues from  billion to  billion and turned profitability from  billion in the red to a  billion profit Denholm said Indeed one of the key reasons the vote to ratify Musk’s moonshot pay plan succeeded in  was because the stakes were markedly different from other CEOs The Tesla board was prepared to pay Musk  if he didn’t hit the targets rather than applying what is known as socalled “board discretion” where corporate directors still pay CEOs who have failed to hit financial markers Oftentimes boards tell investors they don’t want to hold CEOs or executives responsible for economic headwinds or other factors out of their control that contributed to them missing stated financial targets or goals Although boards must balance the need for discretion with the need to keep executives and CEOs in their roles Only in an extreme case would a CEO take home no pay for a longterm award—in addition to no salary cash bonus or timebased stock—because the risk of losing the executive and destabilizing the company would be too high What makes Musk’s pay plan complicated is that investors likely see troubles ahead for Tesla while the board appears to be focused on paying Musk for the targets he achieved in the past Further the magnitude of his pay and the fact that Tesla’s performance has struggled this year has added to the complexity The company announced it would lay off  of its staff and even slashed its summer internship program all while the company is devoting resources to reinstating Musk’s moonshot Musk himself famously ignores the norms most publicly traded company CEOs abide by and appears to act—and tweet—impulsively and without conferring with the independent directors on the board which does little to reassure investors In addition to ratifying his pay plan Tesla is seeking investor approval to move from being incorporated in Delaware to Texas a change that seems motivated by the Delaware judge’s ruling on Musk’s pay According to the voting website “The Delaware Court has shown that it will ignore the will of our stockholders We believe in stockholder rights We believe Texas Courts will respect those rights” In addition to rallying other investors to vote down Musk’s pay the dissident group is asking shareholders to withhold support from Musk’s brother Kimbal Musk and former st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch Kimbal has served on the board for  years and Murdoch is Musk’s friend Neither is truly independent the investors said
I cared for my dad under ‘hospital at home’ in his final weeks. The program is missing one big piece,https://fortune.com/2024/05/21/hospital-at-home-family-caregivers-health-care/,"Tue, 21 May 2024 21:14:02 +0000","Family caregivers do much of the work, but they often receive little warning and no training. They need more support.",fortune.com,I cared for my father  in the last years of his life A lot of that care happened through the hospitalathome program While he received highquality care the support provided to his primary caregiver me fell short Innovation in health care delivery increasingly keeps patients out of the hospital by providing medical care in the home As a result care is being pushed into the home much earlier in the patient journey than ever before One major evolution—starting in the last decade but gaining momentum since COVID—has been the popular hospitalathome program It’s widely supported across the nation with support from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services through the “Acute Hospital Care at Home” waiver The program ends later this year and it’s up for debate how the federal agency should make such models permanent moving forward A bill now being considered by Congress would extend the program Health care at home Either way the trend is clear Health care providers have made the growth of the hospitalathome program a major priority for the coming year Mass General Brigham for example—one of the largest health care systems in the US—has indicated it would like to move  of its medical patients to home care A McKinsey  Company study predicts that health care will continue to be delivered at home to the tune of  billion by  But while it’s embraced by both health care systems and patients the hospitalathome program overlooks a key piece of the puzzle the family caregivers who do so much of the work often with little warning and no training Family caregivers have long been a part of the care ecosystem They cover over  billion worth of unpaid care every year and our health care system is reliant on family caregivers to provide over  of communitybased longterm care According to the National Alliance for Caregiving over  million Americans serve as family caregivers for a disabled or ill relative On average caregivers shoulder  hours of care per week a trend that will only intensify with the momentum of aginginplace and hospitalathome models Despite the growing reliance on them family caregivers have been left out of the equation But as hospitalathome and its ilk gain popularity the care taking place at home is becoming more acute and complex As the primary family caregiver to both of my parents for eight years I intimately understand the emotional and logistical toll caregiving can take both in clinical settings and in the home My mom had pancreatic cancer for seven years and moved in with my family I cared for her until she passed away in my home six years ago My dad had been living with us since then and experienced a major health decline from congestive heart failure Last year we became participants in a hospitalathome program upon his discharge after a hospital stay to treat complications from congestive heart failure At that time I didn’t know what the program was until I found myself sitting in my living room with my recently discharged dad a doctor and a nurse They brought the monitoring equipment and took his vitals The whole time they were talking to him as the patient—and didn’t ask me any questions about the living situation care coverage or daily care needs Once their minute visit ended I was left to figure out all the extra care he needed after a sixday hospital stay I had to cancel a work trip that week because my dad needed extra assistance for his daily care The monitoring equipment was impressive but the many moments he walked a few inches beyond the foot coverage I was being called by their  monitoring line asking to check on him Having experienced this program firsthand while also being a healthtech leader in the industry I want to emphasize that the positives abound for health care systems which can discharge patients from an acute care setting and for patients most of whom prefer to be cared for in their homes However hospitalathome will not reach its full potential until the family caregivers are integrated into the process with the appropriate onboarding and support Supporting family caregivers A few key steps should be taken First be intentional with the onboarding process and education provided to family caregivers Clearly explain the program in a way that sets the caregiver’s role and expectations Lay out how long it’s intended to last ask the caregiver about the home care environment and assess where needs may arise Provide a thorough overview of any resources and support that are available and incorporate the family caregiver as part of the care team Caregivers in this situation are not just players sitting by the bedside as in a hospital setting They are playing the roles of health aides social workers food service and  monitoring beyond key vitals Consider the care in the home environment where daily life distractions and obligations occur In my case caring for my father at home coincided with my work at ianacare a caregiving tech company that I cofounded to help bridge the gaps in homebased care I have learned that the important thing as we make this critical shift of transitioning care into the home is to start by acknowledging the importance of family caregivers The hardest part after all falls to them Clinical evidence demonstrates the key role they play The goals of the provider align with the outcome of wellsupported caregivers with a  reduction in hospital readmission when a family caregiver is involved Meanwhile patients whose caregivers are burned out stressed or fatigued experience a  increase in emergency department utilization I recently spoke with a health care system as they began the process of implementing hospitalathome and they mentioned that caregiver support was important to them—but that they were more concerned about getting the program up and running for the patients first Unfortunately this is the prevalent mindset within health care systems and the unintended consequence is the large amount of stress and pressure placed on family caregivers While hospitalathome is designed to deliver clinical support and professional care the reality is that informal unpaid caregivers do much of the work in the home We’re caring for our loved ones and ensuring that they get the best standard of care in the process The moments between inhome and virtual visits quickly become critical—and that is where family caregivers who are often thrust into that role with little warning and no training come in It’s the last mile of the patient’s care These caregivers need far more attention Proper training and support for them will not only reduce burnout but ultimately lead to better patient outcomes and lowered costs Hospitalathome is the start of other initiatives pushing care in the home so we need to get this right—starting now Jessica Kim is cofounder and executive chairman of ianacare She is a graduate of Brown University and holds an MBA from

design and colors How much do backend developers make Backend developers in the United States earn an average of  according to internal data from ZipRecruiter that was provided to Fortune The overall pay range between states tends to range between  per year or so in Oregon to more than  in Washington DC but there are a range of factors that can influence what a backend developer earns in any specific state or city Julia Pollak Chief Economist at ZipRecruiter says that it’s important to note that salaries can be a tad misleading too as they don’t incorporate total compensation for developers who are often pulling in sizable bonuses and stock options on top of that salary Pollak also says that backend developers may end up earning more than their frontend counterparts “Because backend developers are dealing with ever more data and responsibility for building the data server database logic the job has become incredibly important and crucial” Pollak says “Getting things to run quickly on the back end with vast amounts of data is a very specialized and difficult skill—backend developers need to be really proficient” she says That in a nutshell is why backend developers can command relatively high salaries Cost of living While the average backend developer may earn a relatively high salary they must also keep the cost of living where they live and work in mind A developer earning a high salary in an expensive city may see more of those earnings whittled away by high rent and childcare costs for example than a developer earning a bit less in a cheaper area Again this is something to merely keep in mind for prospective developers looking at highpaying career tracks Backend developer salary by state Below you’ll see the states where backend developers

split up into different parts including both the frontend and backend portions While some developers have “fullstack” skill sets—meaning they work both front and backend—some developers opt to specialize in the front or backend specifically Backend developers tend to work “under the hood” with a lot of data and databases Their proficiency in backend systems and processes isn’t easily obtained either which is what makes a backend developer’s abilities prized in the labor market allowing the average backend dev to earn a sixfigure salary Prospective backend developers should keep in mind that their salaries likely will depend to some degree on where they live and work and the specific skills and programming languages they possess While working on the backend of websites and applications may also not be quite as sexy as designing them for the frontend user it’s a critical process And backend developers may not only command high salaries but could also see big bonuses and other compensation too

in an allornothing choice As a certified financial planner professional I often encourage my clients to start by exploring three options — accepting the rate increase freezing benefits or adjusting policy terms  Accepting the rate increase In some situations the best course of action is to do nothing If your parents financial situation allows them to comfortably absorb the higher rate accepting the premium increase can ensure continuous coverage without sacrificing any benefits From my personal experience this was the best choice for my mothers situation Despite a  premium increase we chose to accept the rate rather than settle for fewer policy benefits I know all too well the cost of inhome care as my dad had Parkinsons disease for nine years and needed hour care the last four months of his life watch now  Freezing the benefits If you have financial concerns about a higher premium you may be able to eliminate or reduce the rate increase by electing to freeze your benefits When this happens you agree to pause the inflation protection benefit for a predetermined time frame in exchange for a lower rate Freezing benefits helps to keep premium costs down without losing coverage altogether It can be a good choice for parents in their early to late s especially if the premium increase exceeds  Recently I advised one of my clients to freeze their benefits when faced with a  premium increase since they are in their late s and the cost difference wasnt a good fit for their situation This change allowed them to maintain the current daily benefit amount but forgo future increases helping manage costs while still providing some coverage  Finding a middle ground Sometimes the full premium increase isnt manageable but youre not ready to freeze benefits completely If youre able to accept some but not all of the premium increase its best to call your insurance company to negotiate your rates For example if the cost is going up  but you can only afford  discuss it with your insurer You could uncover alternatives that an adjusted premium might offer like a shorter benefit period longer elimination period or reduced daily benefit amount However reducing daily benefits should be a last resort because it decreases the insurance payout and can increase outofpocket costs for your parents care Making the best longterm care insurance decisions Age is just a number but so is the cost of longterm care insurance Begin by having transparent conversations with your parents and siblings so you can work together to ensure that everyones needs and concerns are met This discussion should cover everyones perspectives and financial considerations especially the needs and preferences of your aging parents This can be a difficult conversation to navigate

That goal can be reached in so many ways.,search.cnbc.com,Delmaine Donson  E  Getty Images Wedding and engagement season is right around the corner and that means many couples will embark on a path toward marriage One of the most important conversations newlyweds will need to have is figuring out how and who will pay the bills The goal is to ensure the bills are being paid especially on time so the couple remains current with their finances and that means keeping their credit intact Money may not be the most exciting topic to discuss with your new partner but it is a must According to a recent study by the Institute for Divorce Financial Analysts  of all divorces are due to money issues Having a plan and an active dialogue can help strengthen your bond as a couple The way couples approach and accomplish this task can be extremely personal and the end goal can be reached in so many ways No one way is the right way and we will explore some of the more popular ways we have seen this accomplished  ways couples split bill responsibilities Many couples find it best to address their bills like they have approached their marriage They look to commingle their finances like they have their lives Taking this approach the couple would set up a joint account for their bills where all the income they receive would be deposited That joint account would then be used to pay their bills and fund their emergency and other savings accounts This provides a fair amount of transparency to both members of the relationship to see how much money is coming into their account each month and where it is going Some couples would rather not combine their finances in the way previously described and would prefer keeping things more separated We have seen couples that have separate accounts where their respective pay is deposited The couple then will agree to divide certain household expenses for which they would be responsible One member may be tasked with paying the mortgage taxes and insurance while another may pay for the groceries utilities and maintaining the home Using this method can provide the same level of transparency for each spouse if that is what the couple wants or it could also be used to keep things a bit more private watch now Another method we see as financial advisors often combines some of the first two ways discussed In this situation we see each person maintaining their own accounts and they each contribute a determined amount each month to a joint account The joint account would be used to pay all the bills for their collective household Usually one member of the couple would take the lead to make sure the bills are paid and other times we see them divide this responsibility This provides each person the ability to maintain their own accounts while giving the couple transparency around the household bills and what it costs to run it monthly How to make a bill plan as a couple Bills and paying them are a necessary evil for any couple and how it gets done can be quite different from one household to another Whatever method you choose whether it is one outlined here or something very different it is critical that it works for you both There must be an agreement similar to so many things in a relationship between the two people or it simply is not going to be followed Once that is in place you need to ensure that it is being followed the bills are being paid and they are on time too Paying the bills on time will save you the nuisance of paying interest and late fees which could add strain to your relationship Another major benefit is to make sure your individual and credit as a couple is maintained or increased to the highest score possible Having great credit which is helped by paying your bills on time can have a positive effect on your financial situation

world the specter of financial fraud looms large especially for older adults My experience with an yearold client offers a stark illustration While assisting Emma not her real name with email issues I witnessed her vulnerability to scams firsthand Despite my repeated warnings over the years she had readily shared personal information with unknown senders believing she was being conscientious or supporting noble causes This behavior soon led her into a fraudulent scheme where she nearly lost  to a scammer masquerading as a computer services provider This incident was not the first Emma had experienced but it was the most brazen Emmas story is not unique It reflects a growing trend of elder fraud which is both sophisticated and damaging Elder fraud is becoming common — and expensive Elder fraud is an escalating problem in the United States with scammers becoming increasingly cunning They prey on older people often exploiting their loneliness social isolation and sometimes declining cognitive abilities These individuals are most vulnerable as it turns out A recent study from the University of Michigan suggests that older adults who report feeling lonely or isolated are more susceptible to fraud than those who report feeling satisfied with their lives and social circles Meanwhile the National Library of Medicine has published research linking cognitive decline to a greater predisposition to scams Yet these criminals arent just targeting the very old individuals much younger than  are also at risk In  alone more than  adults over  fell victim to financial scams according to the most recent FBI Elder Fraud Report Women are more likely to be victims of elder fraud according to the Womens Institute for a Secure Retirement because there are more women than men over age  and older women are more likely than older men to live alone and to live in poverty Americans  and older lost  billion to cyber fraud in  FBI data shows with an average loss of  per victim More than  older adults lost more than  apiece Recognizing the signs of fraud Elder fraud schemes are diverse ranging from email phishing to impersonation scams each designed to deceive and manipulate their targets into handing over sensitive personal and financial information As fraud tactics become more sophisticated avoiding them can be challenging for those who dont recognize the warning signs which often include Suspicious emails Scam email addresses often have misspellings or odd characters and prompt the receiver to click on links These links may lead to phishing sites that mimic a legitimate website and trick the user into entering sensitive information or could initiate the download of malware adware or scareware onto the users computer Vague email signatures Email signatures from scammers are usually simple sometimes just a first and last name Legitimate businesses provide detailed verifiable contact information including company name address website URL and phone numbers Urgency and threats Phishing attempts typically convey a false sense of urgency or threaten dire consequences to coerce action Requests for personal information Scammers want personal information to hack into a persons financial accounts No legitimate business will ask for credit card numbers login credentials or Social Security numbers over the phone or via email Outofcharacter behavior Some scammers pretend to be family members or friends who urgently need funds — a feat made easier with the dawn of artificial intelligence Proactive measures to protect a loved one watch now For older adults especially those in isolation or experiencing cognitive decline habitual caution may not suffice Establishing a support network of trusted individuals who can step in when financial decisions become confusing is crucial Consider the following proactive measures Early planning Begin organizing a support network around age  particularly for those without extensive family networks or who have a history of cognitive decline For example another of my clients preemptively engaged a professional inhome care management team to address her lack of local family support Security audits by adult children Adult children can help by auditing spam filters setting up password managers and automating bill payments Legal preparations Establishing critical legal documents and setting up trusts can safeguard against the inevitable challenges posed by cognitive decline For example a durable power of attorney for finances designates a trusted individual to manage the financial affairs of someone experiencing diminished capacity while a successor trustee can manage and distribute trust assets on their behalf according to the trust agreement These legal tools are essential for maintaining financial autonomy and security even when direct management becomes impractical or impossible Facing the digital challenge

health insurance coverage decisions for the self-employed and their families need to be made now.,search.cnbc.com,Getty Images Open enrollment season can be a time of trepidation for the selfemployed The stakes are especially high because if you need to buy individual or family coverage the next few weeks could be your only chance for  barring certain exceptions such as moving to a different state getting married divorced or having a child For most people the nationwide open enrollment period for individual and family coverage is your best shot to review your options and enroll in a new plan explained Anthony Lopez vice president of individual and family and small business plans at eHealth a private online marketplace for health insurance in an email Picking health insurance on your own — without the help of a human resources department — can be daunting Instead of throwing up your hands in frustration here are answers to questions selfemployed individuals often have about open enrollment Healthcaregov and other options for information Freelancers consultants independent contractors and other selfemployed individuals can visit wwwhealthcaregov to research and enroll in flexible highquality health coverage either through the federal government or their state depending on where they live You can also choose to work directly with an insurance agent or with a private online marketplace to help you wade through options To be considered selfemployed you cant have anyone working for you If you have even one employee you may be able to use the SHOP Marketplace for small businesses The deadlines you need to stay on top of Most states set a deadline of Dec  for coverage that begins Jan  so dont delay when it comes to signing up for benefits said Alexa Irish cochief executive of Catch which helps selfemployed individuals choose healthcare plans Also remember to pay your first months premium before your health care is supposed to start or youll be out of luck as well If you miss those deadlines theres no wiggle room said Laura Speyer coCEO of Catch If you are already enrolled in a marketplace plan Those who were already enrolled in a plan last year can make changes by Dec  for coverage that begins Jan  Doing nothing will mean they are automatically reenrolled in last years marketplace plan Qualifying for tax credits and other savings Many people assume they wont be entitled to savings but they should still investigate their options Irish said Indeed  of total marketplace enrollees received an advance premium tax credit in February  which lowers their monthly health insurance payment according to data from the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services a federal agency within the US Department of Health and Human Services Credits and other eligible savings are available based on an applicants income and household size and can be estimated even before they officially apply Its advisable to check for savings possibilities every year Irish said What to consider in making coverage decisions The thought process will be similar to what you went through when picking health insurance offered by an employer Whether you are signing up for the first time — or deciding whether to renew your existing plan or choose a different one — youll want to consider factors such as who in the family needs the coverage and for what purposes and how different plans compare in terms of coverage options and cost This analysis needs to take into account copays prescription drugs you take or may start to take whether the plan covers your doctors and outofpocket maximums If youre selfemployed and aiming to grow your business in the coming year possibly by hiring employees its good to know you can enroll in a small business plan at any time of the year Lopez said Small business group plans arent governed by the same open enrollment rules as individual and family plans So you can enroll in an individual plan today then switch over to a group plan in mid if you add a couple employees and want to provide them with health benefits he said How much health insurance costs the selfemployed Cost will vary depending on the plan you choose who is covered and what subsidies youre eligible for But as a general guide the average total monthly premium before tax subsidies in February  was  The average total premium per month paid by consumers after the tax subsidies was  according to the Centers for Medicare  Medicaid Services Selfemployed individuals may also be eligible for a costsharing reduction a discount that lowers the amount paid for deductibles copayments and coinsurance Youll find out what you qualify for when you fill out a marketplace application but keep in mind you need to enroll in a Silver plan one of four categories of marketplace plans to get the costsharing reduction Wading through policy options working with an agent You dont have to go through the process alone There are assisters who are trained and certified by marketplaces to help you apply and enroll If you want more specific help you can also choose to work with an agent or broker who is trained and certified to sell marketplace health plans

time Ive had the same therapist now for five or six years and its mind blowing how lacking in that kind of care I was Just acknowledging that an experience was really hard and taking the time to try and process it we never had time for that It was always Okay we got to go And I think there were many layers to it I couldnt get angry at the lack of government assistance programs because you know an

Images Openenrollment workplace checklist  Health insurance  Savings and spending accounts  Dental and vision plans  Life insurance  Disability insurance  Retirement savings  Beneficiary selection  Compare medical dental and vision plan options Typically employees are presented with two medical insurance plan options one with a higher monthly cost known as your premium and a lower deductible the amount youll have to shell out before your employers plan kicks in and another option where it is the other way around with you paying less each month but required to hit a higher number before your coverage begins If you are completely healthy and only go to the doctor say once a year for a checkup you might want to opt for the socalled highdeductible plan with the lower monthly cost Socalled preventative services like wellness checks and certain immunizations should be free whether or not youve hit your deductible said Caitlin Donovan a spokesperson for the National Patient Advocate Foundation Gruber said that in many cases a highdeductible plan will be a better deal because premiums are so much lower On the other hand paying a higher premium up front will give you more certainty about your outofpocket costs during the year particularly if you end up needing to visit a hospital said Jean Abraham a health economist at the University of Minnesota If you have an illness want to visit multiple doctors or try different treatments in  it may be preferable to have a lower deductible you can hit so that you can then take greater advantage of your workplaces coverage The Warby Parker store in Harvard Square in Cambridge Massachusetts Pat Greenhouse  Boston Globe  Getty Images There are clear tradeoffs Abraham said Individuals differ in their risk preferences Youll need to look beyond your premium and deducible to know what your annual healthcare costs will be under different plans Donovan said Consider also the plans coinsurance rate which is the share youll be on the hook for even after your deductible is met on covered services and what your copayments will be Many plans also have multiple deductibles including one for innetwork services and another for outofnetwork care Meanwhile some employees may find their household size has changed since their last openenrollment period and that they can or need to add someone to their plan If your spouse has their own health insurance option at work youll want to both sit down and compare the different offerings Financially it may take some numbercrunching Donovan said You want to evaluate the different premiums deductibles and copays Every year there may be new choices available  as well as changes in your circumstances Jonathan Gruber economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Its even possible the less expensive option is to each be on their own plan Make sure to know exactly how much your costs will rise by adding another person to your plan For example some employers will extend their coverage to a domestic partner or someone who lives with you but to whom youre not married But in addition to a higher premium and deductible the benefit for a domestic partner will likely trigger a larger tax bill for you because the coverage is counted as additional income by the IRS Some companies will also add a surcharge to your coverage if you add a spouse who has their own workplace health insurance available to them Many employees will notice that the health insurance plans offered by their company dont include dental and vision coverage Instead these coverage areas will pop up as separate options with their own price tags Youll want to read the benefit details and do some rough math to see how much youll save by having the coverage versus paying full price at the dentist or eye doctor said Louise Norris a health policy analyst at Healthinsuranceorg Its especially important to pay attention to the maximum benefit the plan will provide Norris said If the ceiling is low it may be worth paying out of pocket Still even if the plan wont save you a significant amount of money she added it might be worth enrolling if you know that having the benefit will be the motivation you need to make your regular dental and optometry appointments  Consider life disability insurance During open enrollment employees will typically also be presented with different disability and life insurance options Everyone should take the free life insurance their company offers said Carolyn McClanahan a physician certified financial planner and founder of Life Planning Partners in Jacksonville Florida That benefit is usually a multiple of your salary However McClanahan said If a person has any dependents that count on their income this probably isnt enough Although many employers provide the opportunity to buy additional life insurance if a person is healthy it is often cheaper to buy term insurance on the open market instead said McClanahan who is a member of CNBCs Financial Advisor Council Also you wont lose your insurance when you leave employment she added partial view of young woman Aire Images  Moment  Getty Images If you are unhealthy your life insurance through your employer may be all you qualify for McClanahan said In which case she said be sure to accept it and buy as much as you can Disability insurance is also important McClanahan said If your employer offers it you should definitely take it More than  million Americans have a disability according to the Pew Research Center Shortterm disability coverage is very limited she said Everyone needs longterm disability coverage unless they have enough savings that they could basically retire if they cant work anymore Your employer disability coverage may not be enough to support you should you become disabled and so you should also consider an individual disability policy to supplement your work policy McClanahan said  Take advantage of savings spending accounts Your employer may offer savings and spending accounts that can reduce your taxes and help you to afford your healthcare expenses for the year experts say During open enrollment you can opt to put up to around  into a flexible spending account for example Your contribution will be deducted from your paychecks and later your gross income which can lower your tax bill But at the start of the year you should have the full amount to you available for deductibles copayments coinsurance and some drugs There is also a dependent care FSA which you can use to pay for eligible dependent care expenses including costs for children  and younger Health savings accounts have a triple tax benefit Carolyn McClanahan founder of Life Planning Partners Financial experts speak especially highly of health savings accounts or HSAs Health savings accounts have a triple tax benefit  you get a tax deduction when you put the money in the money gets to grow tax free for health care and you can take it out tax free for any healthcare expenses McClanahan said If you can pay for your health expenses out of pocket during the year she said you can let that money grow taxfree throughout your career and use it in retirement she added Not all workers qualify for an HSA To be eligible you need to be enrolled in a highdeductible plan among other requirements  Evaluate your retirement savings Unlike with the previous options you can usually make changes to your retirement savings throughout the year Still the benefit season is a chance to check in with your nest egg experts say Open enrollment can be a natural time to pause and look at your whole picture said Ryan Viktorin a CFP vice present and financial consultant at Fidelity Investments People should generally be saving at least  of their pretax income each year

is also becoming imperative that Europe takes action in response to the measures implemented by the US and China While China bets on colossal amounts in terms of industrial investment particularly in RD and its key position in certain markets especially critical metals the US focus on subsidies quite heavily via the Inflation Reduction Act IRA  The EU also faces its own challenges significant deindustrialisation of some of its Member States high dependence on energy and critical metals supplies and the limited size of the European budget To respond to this the EU has unveiled several plans in recent years aimed at transforming its economy in light of the various challenges it faces climate change digital see diagram As a new decisive democratic moment awaits with the EU elections being held between  and  June it is appropriate to put into perspective the efforts made so far by the EU and the Member States We will start by presenting the different European plans and then explain how the European Green Deal and NGEU work THE EUROPEAN UNIONS MULTIPLE RESPONSES TO CURRENT CHALLENGES Several plans to transform the European economy since  The first plan unveiled by the EU in December  before the health crisis began is the European Green Deal This is structured around a legislative framework embodied by the European climate law adopted shortly after on  March  This set of initiatives aims primarily to make the Old Continent the first climateneutral bloc by  In particular it includes the Green Deal Industrial Plan introduced in February  sometimes presented as the European answer to the US Inflation Reduction Act IRA This plan has four pillars i a simplified regulatory environment ii faster access to funding iii enhancing skills and iv more resilient supply chains In practice these four pillars are reflected in legislation such as the NetZero Industry Act the European Critical Raw Materials Act and a reform of the European electricity market The health crisis has given rise to new needs within the EU and justified the introduction of a largescale recovery plan for the continent NextGenerationEU approved on  December  with an initial budget of EUR  billion which was subsequently increased to EUR  billion The plan aims to get the EU out of the economic crisis caused by the Covid pandemic shock while preparing countries for the green and digital transition It therefore aims to boost the European economy by fully incorporating the objectives of the European Green Deal The NextGenEU plan picks up and reinforces many existing European plans InvestEU Horizon Europe etc but its primary tool is the creation of the Recovery and Resilience Facility or RRF of EUR  billion distributed in the form of loans EUR  billion and grants EUR  billion The war in Ukraine which began in February  highlighted Europe’s vulnerabilities in terms of energy supply particularly with regard to Russian gas imports As a result the European Commission created the REPowerEU plan which aims to strengthen the EU’s energy resilience and independence by diversifying energy sources and investing heavily in the energies of the future This plan which has an envelope of nearly EUR  billion EUR  billion in grants and EUR  billion in loans will nevertheless need to evolve according to the Member States’ use of its funds mainly from the RRF plan and to a lower extent from other European plans Innovation Funds Cohesion Policy Funds European Investment Bank EIB etc Alongside these different plans the European Commission has undertaken a major reform of the European carbon market EU ETS supported by the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism CBAM In addition to encouraging the decarbonisation of the economy the aim of this reform is to generate additional revenues to fund essentially the REPowerEU plan see Box  CARBON MARKET AND EMISSIONS “LEAKAGE” The European Green Deal in support of decarbonisation On  December  the European Commission announced the rollout of the European Green Deal which lays the foundations for concrete climate targets to be met by  A legislative framework was put in place on  March  with the adoption by the European Commission of the European Climate Act which includes the target of net zero CO emissions by  and a  reduction in GHG emissions by  compared to  levels Fit for  This plan covers several schemes such as REPowerEU for the energy component the Innovation Fund and Horizon Europe strategic plan for the research and innovation side the establishment of the CBAM and the Green Deal Industrial Plan announced at the beginning of  The Covid crisis has slowed down the implementation and rollout of the Green Deal However the economic recovery in the context of the NextGenEU plan and the RRF was an opportunity to introduce the first reforms in favour of the green transition and energy resilience In August  after the health crisis the United States adopted the Inflation Reduction Act IRA There were strong reactions from Europe even generating the setting up of a joint task force called the “EUUS Task Force on the IRA” in October  This was not enough however to reassure European decisionmakers The EU therefore launched the Green Deal Industrial Plan on  February  which aims to support private investment through public actionsEP  A plan structured around three pillars i The NetZero Industry Act NZIA To this end the European Commission has created two new institutions the NetZero Europe Platform and the European Hydrogen Bank The NetZero Europe Platform is tasked with bringing together and addressing all measures and reforms related to the NZIA while supporting private investment in what are known as “strategic netzero” technologies of which there are eight solar photovoltaic and solar thermal technologies electrolysers and fuel cells green hydrogen onshore wind energy and offshore renewable energies biogas and biomethane technologies battery and energy storage technologies carbon capture and storage technologies heat pumps and geothermal energy technologies and grid technologies The European Hydrogen Bank plays a similar role to the NetZero Europe Platform but exclusively for this energy source It could also become the preferred intermediary between the EU and Member States regarding potential premiums for importing hydrogen EP within the Union The goal is to produce  million tonnes of hydrogen in Europe and to import the same amount by  Under the supervision of the European Hydrogen Bank EUR  million was channelled through the Innovation Fund The pilot auctions were launched at the end of November  and the successful projects are yet to be selected According to EU estimates by  the value of the global netzero technology market could be EUR  billion while the European ecosystem represented around EUR  billion in  The goals for  are to almost quadruple the rollout of renewable energies to increase sixfold the rollout of heat pumps and to increase fifteenfold the continental production of electric cars The overall aim is to ensure that domestic green energy production meets at least  of demand within the EU ii The second pillar of the European Green Deal Industrial Plan is the Critical Raw Materials Act CRMA This programme aims to scale up and secure the production of critical raw materials to limit disruptions in supply chains Raw materials identified as critical are lithium cobalt nickel gallium borates tungsten and titanium As the EU does not have significant natural resources in rare earth metals only  of annual requirements will be covered by extraction by  it relies on imports The EU has set clear targets for  so as not to depend too heavily on a single country production within the EU refining recycling and extraction will have to cover  of annual requirements and imports of each raw material from one country should not exceed  Another solution is the integration and development of the supply chain and the use of critical raw materials This is because a rare material must first be processed before it enters the supply chain At the present time a number of figures highlight the EU’s dependence on certain countries  of the EU’s supply of magnesium and  of the rare earth metals used in permanent magnets are refined in China  of the world’s cobalt is mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo while  of the EU’s supply of borate comes from Turkey The EU has therefore begun to approach new countries particularly on the African continent with for example the signing of the Sustainable Investment Facilitation Agreement SIFA with Angola in November  iii The third major pillar of the European Industrial Green Deal is the reform of the electricity market This reform extends the Clean Energy for all Europeans Package approved in  as part of the Paris Agreements and the preliminary discussions around the European Green Deal It has two main objectives to secure the energy supply of European citizens and to reduce the dependence of electricity production and supply on fossil fuel and GHGemitting energies Several measures were adopted in March  These include greater price stability with the right to a flatrate contract decorrelated from the price on the electricity market transferring risk to electricity suppliers better information on the diversity of the existing supply and the establishment of suppliers as a last resort in each Member State in order to avoid any shortages This reform also provides for the strengthening of Power Purchase Agreements PPAs which help secure supply and energy costs for end consumers while ensuring a minimum return for producers of decarbonised electricity In this regard twoway ContractsforDifference CfDs were adopted on  October  Concluded between a State and an electricity producer this type of contract aims to reduce price volatility These contracts consist of fixing a price ceiling above which the company will have to pass on its excess profits to the State and a floor price below which companies will be paid a subsidy by the State This mechanism would therefore guarantee the profitability of new energy infrastructures while avoiding a spike in electricity prices particularly during an energy crisis CfDs will come into force for projects that start between three and five years after entry into force of the law Integration of all stakeholders in the economy Access to funding and the need for massive investments generated by the green and digital transition will continue to grow substantially There are three different funding methods European public funding domestic public funding and private funding As we have seen above European public funding involves the implementation of numerous funds under the NextGenEU and REPowerEU plans or other existing programmes Horizon Europe InvestEU etc In domestic terms funding is strictly regulated by EU competition policy This is why the European Commission adopted the Temporary Crisis and Transition FrameworkTCTF The TCTF is integrated into the European Green Deal but does not form part of the Green Deal Industrial Plan although it meets the need for better access to funding The purpose of this reform is to simplify the legal framework and broaden the scope of national public authorities for any measure related to the advancement of the European Green Deal Nevertheless there is a significant risk of marked divergence between European countries not all of which have the same budgetary resources to support their businesses However the RRF only provides a partial answer to this problem At the same time the EU has put in place a number of measures to involve private stakeholders in the green transition process The European Green Deal Investment Plan EGDIP was therefore adopted on  January  This plan was subsequently picked up and developed further to become InvestEU With EUR  billion it should contribute to generating nearly EUR  billion in additional green investment by  according to EU estimates compared to an initial target of EUR  trillion It is aimed at both public and private stakeholders carrying out publicsector duties This programme is still in force today and aims to support private and public investment by guaranteeing funds committed by selected stakeholders implementing partners NextGenerationEU a multifaceted recovery plan AMOUNT OF NRRP IN THE FOUR MAJOR EUROZONE ECONOMIES The NextGenEU plan adopted on  December  currently has a budget of EUR  billion The plan has two components the creation of the Recovery and Resilience Fund RRF and the strengthening of the various preexisting European plans The European Commission is responsible for allocating the budget between States according to two sets of criteria the first set determines  of the budgetary envelope and relates to structural criteria GDP per capita unemployment rate weighting by number of inhabitants while the remaining  is allocated based on economic criteria linked to the effects of the health crisis such as the variation in real GDP in  The two priorities of the NextGenEU plan are the green transition which must represent at least  of the budget of each State’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan NRRP and the digital transition for a minimum of  In addition to measures related to the green and digital transition Member States are also required to include a chapter entitled REPowerEU of the eponymous plan in their NRRP This includes measures contributing to greater energy resilience And lastly Important Projects of Common European Interest IPCEIs mainly concern the construction of largescale plants or energy infrastructure It is the successor of Projects of Common Interest PCIs set up from  under the Presidency of Mr Juncker However these IPCEIs are currently underutilized by Member States and do not seem to represent a sufficient response to the lack of European cooperation In order to ensure the consistency of the national recovery plans and the different measures within the Member States themselves the European Commission has established the Do No Significant Harm DNSH principle This provides for prohibiting the support or implementation of projects that significantly undermine achievement of climate or environmental objectives overexploitation of natural resources high GHG emissions etc Unprecedented funding of the NextGenEU plan Issuance of common debt The funding of these measures has formed the subject of historical decisions in European governance and integration Every seven years EU Member States decide on the longterm financial framework which determines the overall budget and expenditure items for the coming years The last decision dates back to December  and covers the period  This EU budget is required to be balanced As a result EU expenditures should not exceed its own resources which consist mainly of compulsory contributions from Member States customs duties and VAT revenues The first Europeanwide debt issuance took place following the creation of the European Financial Stability Facility EFSF a mechanism introduced during the European sovereign debt crisis in  which applied the principle of backtoback funding It means that a State benefitting from a loan taken out by the EU was responsible for repaying individually the principal and interest on that debt Until the pandemic the EU was in debt to the tune of EUR  billion but this was not a joint debt as not all European States were supporting repayment of the debt but were only acting as guarantors Another milestone was reached in April  with the creation of the SURE programme to support partial unemployment measures in the EU through loans funded by issuances of joint debts This process of sharing debt between EU member countries was then amplified with the creation of the NextGenEU programme in July  which provides for a joint debt issuance of a maximum amount of EUR  billion by  Part of the NextGenEU funds is allocated in the form of loans to Member States and their repayment applies the principle of backtoback funding So each country individually repays the sums allocated to it in the form of loans Only funds allocated in the form of grants will be subject to mutualised repayment However it is important to note that the mutualisation of debt is not the only innovative tool for funding the NextGenEU plan Reform of the EU ETS and implementation of the CBAM are expected to generate nearly EUR  billion in additional revenue per year from  which would double the total current annual revenue of the EU ETS bringing it to around EUR  billion in  Other reforms are expected to contribute to the European budget in the coming years such as the plastics tax or the introduction of a minimum tax rate of  in force since January  for multinationals operating in the EU A safe asset but not the same as a sovereign debt This new form of debt issuance at European level has several implications and requires certain guarantees Given the high demand for safe assets in the current context of stricter prudential requirements and rising interest rates European debt was immediately in high demand As the European Commission is considered a safe issuer it benefits from an interest rate close to but not the same as the ones for Germany and France Firstly the temporary increase in the maximum EU revenue accruing from Member States  from  to  of Gross National Income GNI  intended to fund the NextGenEU programme provides additional guarantees as to the degree of security of this asset The NextGenEU plan is also expected to contribute at least  to the EU’s climate targets As a result a significant share of European debt should be funded by the issuance of green bonds target of  by  making the Union the first issuer on this market and increasing its attractiveness The first issuance of EU green bonds took place on  October  Moreover the European common debt is not expected to continue beyond  the deadline for its repayment set by the European Commission which reinforces its unique nature in relation to government bonds What is the situation of the main countries in terms of their plan of action DISBURSEMENTS ON  European countries have each used the funds released by the RRF taking responsibility for the classification and choice of the type of expenditure they wish to implement in compliance with European legislation This leads to varied and not necessarily coordinated national plans see Box  for more detailed elements of each of these plans The amounts disbursed so far April  represent  of the fund’s total amount Disbursements are expected to accelerate in the coming years as States have until  to make their investments The French and German NRRPs are also supplemented by national measures The main French plan France Relance adopted in September  responds to the health crisis It includes EUR  billion in expenditures equally split in three ways dedicated to the energy transition competitiveness and social cohesion respectively EUR  billion had been disbursed at the end of November  Funded projects relate in particular to the MaPrimeRenov plan the incentive to purchase electric vehicles and the decarbonisation of French industry RECOVERY AND RESILIENCE FACILITY DISBURSEMENT AS OF APRIL  France  was adopted in October  This plan has a longer horizon than France Relance and has an envelope of EUR  billion to be rolled out over  years A large proportion of the resources of France  is intended to support innovative private projects in key sectors such as future energies hydrogen nextgeneration nuclear power etc decarbonisation of industry or IT quantum computing AI etc It follows on from France Relance and focuses exclusively on the digital and green transition The French government would like to undertake the provisioned public expenditures quickly In fact the PisaniFerryMahfouz report showed that the longer we delay the implementation actions the greater the economic cost of climate action becomes This report also highlights the interest of public support in attracting private funding Therefore nearly EUR  of private funding would be generated for every EUR  of public funding granted by the France  plan according to the Comit de Surveillance des Investissements dAvenir CSIA The CSIA estimates that the effects of the France  plan on French real GDP would be between  and  by  and that net job creation would be between  and

industries to which should be added in the case of France the aeronautics spirits and cosmetics sectors and in the case of Italy the shipbuilding industry In the case of France however this surplus is more than offset by the intraEU deficit particularly towards Germany The succession of geopolitical events that has shaken Europe in recent years has favoured the adjustment of the European trade balance The collapse of trade with Russia following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine and the drastic but not total reduction in imports of fossil fuels and industrial metals copper nickel aluminium and others mechanically wiped out a large part of the EU’s deficit with the country which actually reached nearly EUR  billion in  The deficit fell to EUR  billion in  see chart  At the same time the war in Ukraine caused a significant increase in European exports to the country to support Kyiv in its war effort which was reflected in an increase in exports of weapons and ammunition machinery and

years for several items in machinery and technological equipment telecommunications devices and equipment see chart  integrated circuits computers The EU has also seen its balance on certain basic industrial metals steel aluminium deteriorate a distortion partly due to Chinese overproduction which is now subject to increasingly stringent protective measures on the part of the EU This deterioration in the EU’s external position on certain goods or industries cannot be separated from the deindustrialisation process under way in many Western European countries which is still difficult to reverse today But at a time when statements about European economies falling short of Chinese and US competitors are on the rise it is also important to keep in mind that the EU retains significant comparative advantages in several highvalueadded and jobgenerating sectors such as the aerospace and chemical industries in addition to the pharmaceutical industry Evolutions in the trade

particular with the upturn in national electricity production This deficit structurally reflects the country’s strong dependence on hydrocarbons and a significant imbalance on trade in manufactured goods New investment and electrification needs have exacerbated this imbalance for just over five years in addition to the effects of deindustrialisation For  we expect a slight reduction in the trade deficit to EUR  billion driven by a slowdown in investment and imports of intermediate goods at least in the first half of the year In  a year that is expected to be marked by a return to more significant growth in France the trade deficit could once again exceed the symbolic threshold of EUR  billion FRANCE CONTRIBUTIONS TO TRADE BALANCE CHANGES BETWEEN  AND  EUR BN In terms of the trade balance  largely unwound the problems of  which with its burdens and shocks constituted an annus horribilis for French foreign trade In  the oil price partly fell France’s electricity production was back to surplus and the country did not have any strikes in its oil refineries The need for intermediate goods was less than in  the shortages were at that time mitigated by a sharp increase in purchases All these factors with the rebuilding of the aeronautics sector trade surplus at a level close to that of  made it possible to significantly reduce the French trade balance deficit Chart  Reduce but not mitigate Deficits linked to crude and refined hydrocarbons EUR  billion and manufactured goods EUR  billion remained considerable While the former depends on oil prices which France does not control and which should stabilise in  according to our forecasts the second has risen in recent years due to new factors Investment and electrification two new drivers of the French trade deficit From  the trade balance for manufactured goods in France first deteriorated at the pace of the country’s deindustrialisation and the decline in industrial production capacities Thus in  the deficit in manufactured goods reached EUR  billion At the end of a period when deindustrialisation seemed to have been halted it did not change much until  EUR  billion In  however it stood at EUR  billion The Covid period was marked by a number of disruptions the most obvious of which affected economic activity with very high growth volatility Other disruptions are more structural in nature The European Next Generation EU plan and its French version France Relance and more recently France  provide for significant new financing in particular to accelerate the economy’s adaptation to climate change In France this allowed the investment momentum given during the preCovid period from  to continue due to low interest rates and tax incentives after several years of underinvestment  However this increased investment resulted in an increase in capital goods imports As a result of the Covid pandemic more incentives including an environmental bonus have prompted consumers to buy more electric vehicles which are also largely produced abroad FRANCE DECOMPOSITION OF MANUFACTURED GOODS BALANCE EUR BN These two dynamics in terms of capital goods and car fleet electrification explain almost  of the deterioration in the balance of trade deficit for manufactured goods between  and  Chart  With the rise of the electric vehicle and its inputs the automotive trade balance vehicles and car suppliers combined deteriorated by EUR  billion between  and  However any progress towards more electric vehicles will be accompanied by an increase in these sectoral deficits Indeed while the ecological bonus has been revised to further penalise vehicles imported from far away carbon cost of transport and produced with carbon electricity this tightening does not affect those manufactured in the European Union However while China’s rampup has been much talked about France’s bilateral sectoral deficit with this country increased from EUR  billion in  to  billion in  while that with Germany rose from  billion to  billion particularly after the opening of the Tesla plant in Berlin in September  The other major deterioration relates to the structural increase in capital goods imports which led to an increase of the deficit on this item it oscillated between EUR  and  billion per year until  and has increased since then to reach EUR  billion in  Of course corporate investment stalled at the end of  and deteriorated underlying drivers high interest rates lacklustre demand suggest that this will still be the case in the first half of  which will dampen capital goods imports However the continuation of substantial support with France  and France Green Industry including the launch of the tax credit for investments in green industry CIV suggests a recovery in investment momentum and with it a deterioration in the deficit on capital goods In the second half of  and the first half of  the poor economic situation is mitigating the external deficit A notable reduction in the trade in intermediate goods has been observed in recent months an item for which France has a deficit The decrease in trade is therefore reducing the overall trade deficit However this is also a negative leading indicator in terms of the economic situation Indeed the scale of imports of inputs for other sectors intermediate goods can enable to anticipate the evolution of industrial production When as in  input shortages prevented many companies from fulfilling their order books they had to import much more when possible This increase in imports could therefore suggest that production would follow suit Subsequently when the backlog was filled imports of inputs normalised which is a precursor to slower production growth FRANCE IMPORTS OF OTHER INDUSTRIAL GOODS IN

cumulative terms by  point for French growth in the third and fourth quarters of  The breakdown of these changes in value statistics not available in terms of volume shows that nearly half of this negative contribution could have been explained by intermediate goods The reduction in imports of this type of goods could explain this decrease Trade balance data from January  suggests that imports continued to contract Supply pressures could reappear due to the Red Sea situation While at least a transient impact is likely the PMI survey’s delivery times indicators have not deteriorated as much as in  Less dynamic imports of intermediate goods would be consistent with very moderate growth of the French economy at the beginning of  While the effect of reducing the trade in intermediate goods is to reduce the French trade deficit something is also happening on the export side particularly in relation to Germany FRANCE CHANGE IN EXPORTS TO GERMANY  VS  EUR BN The German economy stagnated with growth of  in  and this is expected to remain at zero in  The French economy is exposed to this via two channels the fact that German consumers are buying fewer finished products particularly French and the drop in French inputs incorporated into German industry The trend of French exports to Germany suggests that this second risk already started to materialise in  Although the fall in these exports was overall only EUR  million in  compared to  this hides an increase of almost EUR  billion in the first half of the year and a loss slightly higher in the second against a backdrop of contraction in German GDP  qq in the fourth quarter of  Intermediate goods accounted for the main declines in French exports to Germany Chart  particularly inputs of the chemical industry as well as those used mainly in the automotive sector electronic components or also in construction plastics metals This reflects the weakness of German industrial production which is particularly noticeable in the chemical or automotive sectors while activity in the construction sector is also suffering a marked decline What should we expect for  and what is the outlook for  In  assuming a stabilisation of the oil price few changes are to be expected with regard to the French energy balance Regarding manufactured goods the improvement in the deficit for intermediate goods and the stabilisation of capital goods imports envisaged in the first half of the year linked to the transitional fall in corporate investment would allow a slight improvement in the trade balance to EUR  billion despite a deterioration in the balance for the automotive sector which seems to be continuing For  our scenario anticipates both a return to French GDP growth  after a forecast of  in  and a rebound in corporate investment  in  after  in  two factors that should boost French imports of intermediate goods and capital goods As a result the trade deficit could once again exceed the symbolic threshold

the word confidence takes a central role in the communication and press conferences of central banks confidence that the restrictive policy stance will succeed in bringing inflation under control confidence that there will be room to lower official interest rates In the US in Jerome Powell’s press conferences that follow the FOMC meetings the number of references to ‘confidence’ by journalists as well as the Fed Chair has jumped this year chart  It reflects an expectation that with the target range of the federal funds rate having been raised to  to  more than  months ago the time would soon be ripe for the Federal Reserve to start cutting rates The statement of the January  FOMC meeting hinted in that direction hence the numerous questions of journalists during the press conference about when and why the FOMC would be sufficiently confident that the decline of inflation would warrant a lowering of the policy rate In March Jerome Powell’s comments before the Senate Banking Committee reinforced the expectation that rate cuts were coming However more recently the pendulum has swung back in the opposite direction on the back of disappointing inflation data At the postFOMC press conference on  March a journalist asked whether the recent inflation data had dented the Fed’s confidence that inflation was continually moving down Unsurprisingly the Fed Chair replied “It certainly hasn’t improved our confidence—it hasn’t raised anyone’s confidence” The message following the FOMC meeting of  AprilMay was even stronger “What we said is that we need to be more confident and weve said my colleagues and I today said that we didnt see progress in the first quarter and Ive said that it appears then that its going to take longer for us to reach that point of confidence so I dont know how long itll take I can just say that when we get that confidence then rate cuts will be in scope and I dont know exactly when that will be” Consequently we are back in a ‘high for long’ environment for the federal funds rate Previously we had entered in such a regime in the fall of  reflecting a view that the policy rate was probably at its cyclical peak the terminal rate but that it would take considerable time before an easing could be envisaged It feels like watching the sequel of a movie including the question whether it will be as good as the first one In the US the first ‘high for longer’ era saw a resilient economy labour market GDP growth in the fourth quarter of  but at the current juncture the key question which was not asked during the latest press conference is whether the economy can remain as resilient if the federal funds rate stays at its current level until the latter part of the year or even longer or whether the risk of a hard landing is increasing To a large degree the answer depends on the interest rate sensitivity of the US economy which in turn is influenced by the degree of leverage of businesses and households whether debt is at fixed or variable rates as well as the resilience of earnings and income The Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Report which was published in April gives some comfort  “balance sheets in the nonfinancial business and household sectors remained sound” but also warns that “a sharp downturn in economic activity would depress business earnings and household incomes and could reduce the debtservicing capacity of smaller riskier businesses with already low ICRs as well as particularly financially stretched households” Clearly more than ever the focus will remain on the economic data in terms of inflation in view of its influence on monetary policy and in order to gauge the resilience of the economy demand and activity

longerterm view introduces an additional observation the impulse of lending to households are still close to those seen at the historic low at the beginning of  whilst that of lending to business have not returned to such levels since Meanwhile movements in real GDP and in outstanding loans have been relatively tightly synchronised The former saw a modest upturn in the first quarter  yearonyear after two quarters of barely positive growth in the third and fourth quarters of   in both cases At the same time and for the first time since the summer of  and the beginning of the ECB cycle of rate increases outstanding credit in the private sector has stopped slowing down  yearonyear in December   in March  However these overall trends need to be put in perspective since they are due solely to lending to the financial sector with outstanding loans to households  and  respectively and to a lesser extent loans to nonfinancial companies  and  continuing to slow albeit less markedly than in previous quarters The  banks surveyed in the first fortnight of March for the ECB’s Bank Lending Survey indicated that they had only very slightly tightened their credit standards applied to the approval of loans for businesses in the first quarter of  and more importantly by less than they had expected at the time of the previous survey At the same time and for the first time in three years they had eased their credit standards for mortgages They also continued to tighten lending standards for consumer loans where the share of new production considered as higher risk has increased Overall the increase in perceived risk has encouraged a tightening of terms and conditions whilst stiffer competition particularly for mortgages and greater risk tolerance have pushed towards an easing of lending conditions The fall in demand for loans and the drawing down of credit lines by businesses has surprised in terms of its scale with banks expecting a stabilisation on average in the survey conducted during the fourth quarter of  Demand for mortgages has seen a more modest contraction Demand for consumer loans has stayed more or less stable As in previous quarters demand for bank financing was negatively affected by higher interest rates a reduction in productive investment by companies and the weakness of consumer confidence Banks have reported reduced ability to collect resources from their retail banking clients but also better access to bond market and to a lesser extent to the money market The continued reduction of Eurosystem’s securities portfolio had negative effects on financing conditions and liquidity positions over the last six months which contributed to the tightening of lending conditions and the contraction of new production Banks believe that this process has not yet had an effect on lending conditions but that they could be affected over the next six months Repayments under TLTRO III continued to weigh on the liquidity positions of lending establishments However because of the significant repayments since November  and the now modest residual outstandings from these operations the impact on their own financing conditions is considered negligible and the effect on conditions applied to clients is considered neutral Banks reported a positive impact from the increase in key policy rates on interest margins over the past six months but they now expect this to diminish over the next six months Conversely they highlight the depressive effect on financing volumes that they expect to persist over the next six months Lastly they believe that the overall effect of higher rates on levels of banking profitability will be negative over that period due to the increase in the cost of risk This assessment holds true for banking systems where the share of variablerate loans is relatively high Portugal Finland and to a lesser extent Italy and Spain which is not the case for France Belgium and Germany For the second quarter of  the banks expect a modest fall in demand for financing from business and an increase in demand from households They expect lending conditions rates guarantees etc to be tightened slightly on loans to companies and to stay more or less the same for households We believe that demand for borrowing will continue to be constrained by financing costs which will remain lastingly higher than those seen up until  and be penalised by expectations of adjustments in real estate markets Amongst other factors this will support the disinflationary trend in the euro zone annual inflation stable at  in March

also cause a depreciation of the dollar GENERAL GOVERNMENT GROSS DEBT IN  OF GDP The IMF’s latest Fiscal Monitor offers sobering reading Between  and  many advanced economies are projected to see an increase in their public sector debt to GDP ratio chart  Within the Eurozone between  and  the largest increase in percentage points pp of GDP is expected in Slovakia  pp Estonia  pp Belgium  pp and Finland  pp Italy  pp Luxembourg  pp the Netherlands  pp and France  pp are also projected to see a significant increase  Clearly the economic importance of such a development  including possible concerns about debt sustainability  depends on the initial debt level On the other hand former crisis countries are expected to make huge progress in terms of debt reduction Greece  pp Cyprus  pp Portugal  pp Ireland  pp Germany should also see a decline in its debt ratio  pp Amongst the advanced economies the US ranks second in terms of increase of the public debt ratio   pp This projection is based on the February  Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for IMF staff’s policy and macroeconomic assumptions Basically the CBO supposes expenditures and revenues will evolve in line with what is scheduled under current law typically until  and thereafter grow in line with nominal GDP Under these assumptions the CBO estimates that the public sector deficit would average  of GDP between  and  and reach  percent of GDP in  Consequently debt held by the public would reach  of GDP in   in  and  in  These numbers could trigger a reaction of incredulity Given the scale of the deterioration of US public finances fiscal policy will have to adjust by structurally reducing annual deficits meaning that these debt ratios should never be reached GENERAL GOVERNMENT GROSS DEBT IN  OF GDP However the challenge will be huge A structural reduction of the budget deficit would probably require a combination of both tax increases which are politically unpopular and spending cuts equally unpopular and difficult However mandatory spending   percent of GDP in  is expected to rise steadily driven by the cost of major health care programs on the back of rising health care costs per person and population ageing Scaling these back will be a complicated effort The same also applies to discretionary spending which represents a smaller share of GDP   percent in   and “includes most defense spending and spending for many nondefense activities such as elementary and secondary education housing assistance international affairs the administration of justice and highway programs” Finally net interest charges are projected to more than double—from  percent of GDP in  to  percent of GDP in  driven by rising debt and the refinancing of the outstanding debt at a higher interest rate Moreover the evolution of real GDP growth won’t help either It is expected to slow down from  between  to on average  thereafter due to slower growth of the labour force as well as labour productivity Whether the US manages to bring its public finances under control also matters for the rest of the world given the central role of the US Treasury market and the US dollar in the global financial system Persistent high budget deficits could exert upward pressure on Treasury yields The IMF has calculated that a temporary  percentage point increase in the US primary deficit the budget balance excluding interest charges is associated with a rise in the term premium of about  basis points in the quarters that follow One should assume that a permanent increase in the primary deficit would have a lasting impact on bond yields thereby influencing financing conditions of the private sector as well This would probably weigh on longerterm GDP growth and would complicate matters in terms of debtGDP dynamics In addition there would be spillover effects to other advanced economies as well as to emerging and developing economies According to the IMF “a  percentage point spike in US rates is associated with a rise in longterm nominal interest rates that peaks at  basis points in other advanced economies with a persistent impact over many months”  For emerging market economies the impact is even bigger with a peak increase in longterm interest rates of  basis points Interestingly the IMF also finds an adverse impact on longterm interest rates abroad of US fiscal policy uncertainty such as the debt ceiling and government shutdown ‘cliffhangers’ that have become more frequent in recent years Finally absence of progress in terms of public finances could end up weighing on the appetite of foreign investors to buy US Treasuries and US assets more generally This would weaken the dollar and could put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates in the US thereby complicating the budgetary consolidation effort To conclude for domestic as well as international reasons it’s important to put the objective of healthy public finances high on the political agenda “Whether the US manages to bring its public finances under control also matters for the rest of the world given the central role of the US Treasury market and the US dollar in the global financial system Persistent high budget deficits could exert upward pressure on US Treasury yields and weigh on growth in the US as well as abroad”

cushions the impact of higher US Treasury yields on longterm interest rates in the Eurozone The evolution of longterm government bond yields tends to be highly correlated internationally This may reflect the synchronization of real growth inflation and monetary policy the role of fluctuations in risk appetite which are also very correlated globally as well as international capital flows by investors seeking attractive opportunities in terms of yield WEEKLY CHANGE IN YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND YIELDS  Chart  illustrates this phenomenon for US and German year yields Clearly the relationship between weekly changes in both markets is very close the changes having the same sign in about  of observations but as shown in chart  it fluctuates over time Historically the beta from the regression of the weekly change in German yields as a function of the weekly change in US yields has fluctuated more for year yields than for year yields This may reflect a bigger influence on the former of the nearterm outlook for monetary policy Sometimes this is highly synchronised which is associated with a high beta and sometimes it isn’t in which case the beta will be low Since  the beta for longterm bond yields has been higher than for shortterm yields most of the time To a large extent this is related to a stable and very accommodative monetary policy with rates being at the zero lower bound in the US and even in negative territory in the Eurozone for a considerable number of years This weighs on the beta for year bonds whereas for year bonds fluctuations in the term premium play a bigger role GERMAN VS US BOND YIELDS WEEK ROLLING BETA The high correlation between changes in longterm yields in the US and Germany is particularly important at the current juncture considering the change in tone from the Federal Reserve Until recently the message was that the Fed would soon become sufficiently confident that inflation would move sustainably to  However against a background of ongoing growth resilience and stubborn inflation this message has now changed with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell noting that “it will likely take more time for officials to gain the necessary confidence that price growth is headed toward the Fed’s  goal before lower borrowing costs” This vindicates developments in the US Treasury market which has seen an increase in year yields since the start of the year of  basis points Should the likelihood increase that the Federal Reserve refrains from cutting rates this year Treasury yields would probably continue to rise which given the bond market correlation discussed above could put upward pressure on yields in the Eurozone Such a development would be most unwelcome because it might delay the economic recovery there This concern is warranted After all in Germany the year Bund yield has increased  bp since the start of the year much less so than in the US This reflects for a part a repricing of the monetary policy outlook with rate cuts starting later June rather than April and being more gradual The increase in US yields has certainly also played a role in line with the historical relationship How does the rise in German yields compare to expectations based on the statistical relationship between both bond markets and given the change in US yields GERMAN BUND YEAR RATE OBSERVED MINUS ESTIMATED CHANGE Chart  shows the difference between the observed change in Bund yields and the estimated change In recent weeks this difference which corresponds to the regression residual has become increasingly negative implying that the rise in German yields has been smaller than expected This probably reflects a conviction by investors that the ECB will start cutting its policy rate earlier than the Federal Reserve This monetary desynchronisation is linked to a notable difference in terms of inflation which continues to decline in the Eurozone whereas this movement has stopped at least for the time being in the US Therefore when the ECB signals that it will cut policy rates in the near term markets are not surprised What’s more they consider such a move is warranted the message from the ECB is credible because it is

synchronous move by the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in June depending on meeting dates  for the ECB  for the Fed and  for the BoE Such a synchronicity though unsurprising was however uncertain given the higherthanexpected January and February  US inflation figures some desynchronization of business cycles and the uncertainty inherent in any forecast Developments during the week of  April led us to revise our Fed and ECB call and the BoE scenario may have to be adjusted too in the near future With US inflation as measured by the CPI again surprising on the upside in March we now expect only two rate cuts by the Fed this year the first one in July and the second one in December instead of three previously For the ECB we keep our forecast of a first rate cut in June but we have ruled out our backtoback cuts forecast ie June July and September favouring a more gradual easing of one cut per quarter in June September and December more in line with the ECB’s cautious stance so far For the United States the main argument for lower policy rates  to accompany lower inflation  is becoming more difficult to advocate owing to limited disinflation progress if at all The argument that the Fed could lower rates despite the current resilience of growth  on the grounds that this strength would primarily benefit from a noninflationary supplyside recovery supported by investment efforts productivity gains and an immigrationinduced boost to labor force  also seems to be weakened Monetary easing can however respond to more negative signs which are emerging in the labour market that put into perspective the robustness of nonfarm payrolls gains until March But these warning signs remain limited for now Looking ahead to  the US economy’s expected soft landing scenario which combines a return to potential growth and a continued slow decline in inflation to the  target does not require nor permit rapid rate cuts The situation in the euro area is different and the case for rate cuts from June onwards is more compelling True on an annual average basis we see Eurozone growth significantly increase between   and   while US growth would decrease also significantly  after  But Eurozone starting position is much less favourable than the US one The recovery remains to be confirmed on this side of the Atlantic while growth is stronger footed in the US In other words Eurozone growth needs support while US growth needs to be restrained ECB interest rate cuts would help support the recovery of the economy against a background of falling inflation These cuts would also facilitate the necessary fiscal consolidation efforts All in all and as Christine Lagarde heralded it during the press conference early March the ECB knew a little more at its meeting on  April about the data conducive to starting its monetary easing cycle but not enough to act and cut It should have gathered enough information and therefore “know a lot more” by the next meeting on  June to make the first rate cut Then according to our forecasts the economic conditions would allow only a very gradual easing of monetary policy It will be a matter of accompanying the recovery without triggering a rebound in inflation while the stickiness of some of its components prevent it from falling more significantly not to mention the possible inflationary effects of the recent tensions on oil and gas prices If it claims to be independent of the Fed the ECB cannot completely ignore another possible source of imported inflation if acting before and possibly with more cuts than the Fed led to a marked depreciation of the eurodollar While the conditions for the ECB to cut rates seem about to be achieved the possibility is rising that the Fed will not cut them at all  or even that it will have to raise them again  given the resilience of growth and inflation What could be the consequences On the one hand this could undermine financial markets and economic agents whose current riskon mood and upturn in confidence are partly driven by rate cuts expectations If the latter were to be disappointed this could precipitate a correction in the financial markets and a business cycle downturn On the other hand a Fed’s monetary status quo would not necessarily be bad news if it is partly the result of the solid performance of the US economy if the real world is doing well it is a good sign for the financial world In our scenario the ECB would end up cutting rates before the Fed which would be noteworthy news and a wellfounded move according to our forecasts It should be noted that several emerging market central banks have already started cutting rates and that the Swiss National Bank SNB paved the way for developed country central banks in March The BoJ continues however to stand out from its peers starting only to embark on a process of monetary tightening After the “big tightening” in  when rate hikes were the rule the time for a synchronous “big easing” has not yet come Starting in  the rate cuts would remain scattered in

suffer from weaker confidence and a PMI below  Focusing on the Eurozone the improvement is strong especially in manufacturing where momentum is at the th percentile of the historical distribution whereas in services momentum is at the th percentile The improvement is broadbased with in manufacturing very high scores for new orders and the quantity of purchases In services business expectations and the assessment of new business opportunities have picked up markedly Momentum in terms of employment on the other hand is slower in both services and especially manufacturing This may reflect that due to labour hoarding companies have enough staff to meet the expected increase in demand In such case productivity would improve which would be welcomed by companies given the pressure coming for wage growth In terms of inflation input price momentum has increased in manufacturing which may be related to the consequences of the supply disruption from the attacks in the Red Sea Output price momentum on the other hand is only slightly positive This also applies to services where importantly input price momentum is negative reflecting that an increasing number of companies are reporting an

market reaction Is the latter abnormally strong like in early  or in line with expectations This will allow to gauge whether investors are still predominantly concerned about inflation or whether their focus is shifting to the employment data Major central banks have repeatedly insisted that future monetary policy decisions will be data dependent They want to avoid easing too early or hiking rates too much This stance is understandable considering the uncertainties about monetary transmission how much of the effect of past tightening still needs to manifest itself  the question about the ‘last mile’ of disinflation will it be more difficult than the early part of the ‘race’ the gradual improvement of survey data in the Eurozone and US growth that continues at a healthy pace As a consequence the mutual influence between data financial markets and central banks has intensified More than ever everybody is scrutinizing data and the market reaction through its influence on interest rates can impact the subsequent releases as well Unsurprisingly in this triangular relationship inflation plays a dominant role given that central banks pursue an inflation target News about inflation influences the pricing of fixed income and other instruments through the expected impact on future policy rates on the growth outlook and investor risk appetite INFLATION SURPRISES AND FED FUNDS FUTURE In the United States several inflation data are published on a monthly or quarterly basis and their market impact depends on the timeliness of the data The monthly core PCE numbers are published later in the month after the CPI data have already been published The latter are an input for the forecasts of the former and therefore data surprises the difference between the published number and the consensus forecast tend to be very small and often zero for the core PCE Interestingly although the core PCE is the preferred inflation measure of the Federal Open Market Committee the market reaction is larger for the consumer price data because they are published earlier Consensus data are available for monthonmonth and yearonyear headline and core inflation This allows to calculate the inflation surprise ie the difference between the actual number and the consensus forecast and to see how it influences expectations of future monetary policy as reflected in the financial futures contracts on the federal funds rate The table shows the results of a regression of the change on the release day of CPI inflation data in the federal funds future expiring in December  as a function of the inflation surprise INFLATION SUPRISE AND CHANGE IN FED FUNDS FUTURE DECEMBER  CONTRACT I NFLATION SURPRISES AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE IN FED FUNDS FUTURE All four inflation measures are statistically significant but the monthly change in the core CPI is clearly superior Its close correlation with the change in the fed funds future rate is illustrated in chart  The regressions mentioned in the table allow us to estimate the change in the federal funds rate future for a given inflation surprise and to calculate the difference with the observed change We call this regression residual the unexpected change in the fed funds future rate These results are shown in chart  Three phases can be distinguished Firstly in  the unexpected changes both positive and negative in the federal funds future rate were rather significant possibly reflecting a period of heightened complexity in assessing the outlook for monetary policy considering that inflation was very high and that the policy rate was still very low Secondly the inflation releases of February inflation as expected and March  inflation  basis points higher than anticipated saw unexpectedly large increases in the federal funds future rate Thirdly as of the second half of  the market reaction was much more in line with expectations rather small regression residuals Changes in market pricing including under or overreactions may be related to the level of the policy rate and the signals given by the Federal Reserve about its future evolution The latter refer to the ‘dot plot’ the FOMC members’ projections for the federal funds rate OBSERVED FED FUNDS RATE PROJECTED RATE AND UNEXPECTED CHANGE IN FED FUNDS FUTURE In chart  the projection for the end of  has been used Towards the end of  the federal funds rate moved above the ‘dot plot’ implying that the FOMC members were anticipating a future policy easing The heightened sensitivity of financial markets to inflation data early on in  may reflect a discomfort about this message and hence concerns about premature easing Subsequently the additional rate hikes and the upward revisions of the ‘dot plot’ have probable assuaged these worries leading to financial market reactions on the occasion of inflation data releases that were more in line with expectations Going forward Fed watching will consist of monitoring the inflation dynamics and surprises as well as the unexpected change in the federal funds future rate in reaction to these releases This will allow to gauge whether investors are still predominantly concerned about inflation or whether their focus is shifting to the employment data keeping in mind that the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate

an assumption of a range between  and  for the ECB deposit rate as the end point of the easing cycle Recent communication by the Federal Reserve and the ECB has made it clear that the first cut in official interest rates is coming On the presentation of the semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress Jerome Powell stated that the FOMC is waiting to become more confident that inflation is sustainably moving to  adding “When we do get that confidence — and we’re not far from it — it’ll be appropriate to begin to dial back the level of restriction” In his press conference on  March following the FOMC meeting he confirmed the message that policy easing will start this year Earlier this month Christine Lagarde had mentioned during her press conference that the ECB is making good progress towards its inflation target but that more data are needed to be sufficiently confident that the inflation target will be reached “We will know a little more in April but we will know a lot more in June” So far for the easy question will there be a rate cut so let’s move on to the difficult questions of how many cuts and how fast What will be the ‘other’ terminal rate ie the rate at which central banks will stop reducing their policy rate At first glance both central banks are saying the same it depends on the data but upon closer inspection the ECB communication is more opaque than that of the Federal Reserve During his press conference Jerome Powell referred to the FOMC members’ projections for the federal funds rate the ‘dot plot’ “If the economy evolves as projected the median participant projects that the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will be  percent at the end of this year  percent at the end of  and  percent at the end of —still above the median longerterm funds rate” Clearly given the datadependency of policy the policy rate path decided by the Fed would be different should the economy evolve differently than expected Nevertheless the dot plot provides a clear picture of the base scenario that the FOMC members have in mind and serves as a good reference point for economic agents Speaking at the recent ECB Watchers conference Christine Lagarde stated “We cannot precommit to a particular rate path however tempting that is however much some of you would like to see it If we are honest to our methodology and if we have discipline in adhering to this principle we cannot” The absence of guidance on Eurozone policy rates there is no ECB dot plot raises two questions does it matter and how should one go about in assessing how far rates could be cut Concerning the former in theory one would expect a positive impact on macroeconomic performance from publishing interest rate projections They should lower the uncertainty about the future interest rate path Consequently households and companies may be more eager to react to the prospect of rate cuts as reflected in these projections than to those that can be inferred from financial markets and which are inherently more volatile Interest rate uncertainty matters because of its negative impact on firm decisions However one should be mindful that major changes in the interest rate projections could increase uncertainty by wrongfooting markets households and firms str forward rate At the current juncture the more relevant question in the Eurozone is how fast and how much policy rates might be cut in this cycle under the hypothesis that key economic variables inflation growth wages etc would evolve in line with the latest ECB staff projections Several approaches could be adopted table The first consists of looking at the consensus forecast The latest ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts March  sees the deposit rate which is currently at  dropping to  at the end of this year  at the end of  before reaching its longterm projection of  in  Secondly one could look at market pricing Based on the euro shortterm rate STR forward curve markets expect a decline in the deposit rate of  basis points bp by the end of this year and  bp by the end of  chart  However market pricing can fluctuate significantly in reaction to data surprises and comments of ECB governing council members A shown in chart  based on STR futures the implied interest rate for December  had dropped about  basis points in the fourth quarter of  before rising again approximately  basis points Clearly the stability of the deposit rate the last hike occurred at the September  governing council meeting did not stop market pricing for the future path to be very volatile str forward rate Thirdly a simple approach consists of applying the expected decline in inflation to the nominal deposit rate In doing so one implicitly assumes that the current real policy rate should remain appropriate going forward This makes little sense High real interest rates are necessary when inflation needs to be brought back under control but subsequently real rates should be lowered through nominal policy rate cuts that are bigger than the decline in inflation For this reason a fourth approach consists of trying to understand the ECB’s reaction function Governing council members have repeatedly explained that it is built around three criteria the inflation outlook the dynamics of underlying inflation and the strength of monetary transmission However this does not answer the question of calibration at which point will the nominal policy rate have dropped sufficiently considering the inflation outlook and the monetary environment The historical experience offers little help due to the limited number of easing cycles and the specificity of the then prevailing economic environment A more obvious approach in theory at least is to look at the neutral rate ie the real shortterm interest rate that is consistent with output corresponding to its potential level whereby inflation is stable and consistent with the central bank’s objective This rate cannot be observed and empirical estimates depend on the models and assumptions that have been used Recent research by the ECB shows that since the second half of  modelbased estimates “have ranged between about minus threequarters of a percentage point to around half a percentage point” with the median estimate slightly above zero Interestingly this is rather close to the implied real rate that can be inferred from the ECB Survey of Monetary Analysts which has headline inflation in line with the ECB target of  as of the third quarter of  for core inflation this is expected to occur a quarter later and the ECB deposit rate dropping to  in  Q and to  as of  Q In conclusion although the ECB still needs to decide on its first rate cut it is important to gauge the speed and extent of the policy easing

yield volatility could be high US Crosssectional dispersion for quarterly forecasts for real GDP In the US the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters SPF of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia paints a rather upbeat picture of the economic outlook Admittedly growth is expected to slow down in the second quarter of this year but a healthy pace should be maintained in the following quarters In the Eurozone the ECBs Survey of Professional Forecasters points towards a gradual pickup in quarterly growth this year Economists seem to be in broad agreement on these expected developments Chart  shows for the US the dispersion of quarterly real GDP growth forecasts of the survey participants Unsurprisingly as the forecast horizon lengthens the dispersion tends to decline Forecasters may have strongly diverging opinions about nearterm developments reflected in high disagreement between forecasters whereas this is less likely in the medium run Interestingly for the latest SPF the dispersion across forecast horizons is lower than what was observed at the start of  and  For the latter the high dispersion might have been due to disagreement about the consequences of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve At the current juncture the prospect of rate cuts may explain the limited dispersion of growth forecasts It should be noted that this dispersion is also well below the average calculated using all surveys since the start of  Turning to the Eurozone table  shows the standard deviation of the survey participants’ forecasts for real GDP Since the survey round of  Q this measure of disagreement for the two quarters ahead forecast has dropped significantly In the  Q survey it declined to  a number last seen in  Q Since the second half of last year the six quarters ahead forecast dispersion has also declined dropping to a very low value of  Eurozone standard deviation of real GDP forecasts A low disagreement does not imply that forecasters do not feel uncertain It simple means they assess things in a similar way The user of economic forecasts should welcome low disagreement because the forecast provides a stronger signal However in financial markets low disagreement increases the sensitivity of asset prices to unexpected developments and to a change in the most likely scenario Consequently it is important to also look at the sources of risk and uncertainty Table  provides a nonexhaustive overview of key ‘known unknowns’ and their likely economic consequences Firstly there is the issue of the delayed effects of past monetary tightening which means that part of the effects still needs to manifest itself This entails a risk that at present we are still underestimating the effects of past monetary tightening As these become clearer the impact on growth in the US and the eurozone would be negative and the disinflationary process would be stronger causing a decline in bond yields Secondly there is the possibility that central banks would adopt a more cautious stance when cutting policy rates Admittedly recent statements by Jerome Powell and Christine Lagarde have already cooled down overly optimistic market expectations in terms of the timing and pace of policy easing but should inflation be stickier than anticipated policy rates could be kept at an elevated level for longer Such an outcome would have a negative impact on growth Eventually inflation would decline more but the disinflation process would have taken more time Bond market volatility would be high yields would initially rise as investors realize that the pricing of rate cuts was too optimistic but in a second stage this would be followed by a bigger decline in reaction to lower growth and the decline in inflation Thirdly the US economy might experience a ‘no landing’ scenario In the course of  the consensus view has evolved from ‘a recession is likely’ to ‘a soft landing becomes the base scenario’ In a ‘no landing’ scenario growth remains strong which stops inflation from declining sufficiently Stronger than expected US growth would have a marginally positive effect in the Eurozone on growth via increased exports to the US and inflation to the extent that US growth would underpin commodity prices andor cause an appreciation of the dollar versus the euro In this scenario bond yields would increase Fourthly there is the risk of no takeoff in the Eurozone A potential catalyst would be that companies expecting a subdued demand outlook increasingly make staff redundant which would weigh on household spending and trigger a selfreinforcing negative spiral The impact of such a scenario should be relatively small for the US given the limited openness of that economy whereas it would have a clear negative impact compared to the base scenario in the Eurozone both in terms of growth and inflation The consequences for US inflation would be nonsignificant Eurozone bond yields would decline Impact on outlook In addition to the economic known unknowns political and geopolitical uncertainties and risks should also be taken into consideration Will the elections for the European Parliament in June bring greater alignment between the EU member states How will the outcome of the US presidential election on  November influence the US stance on geopolitical issues It is unlikely that these uncertainties would have an economic impact in the short run although risk averse investors might decide to increase their exposure to government bonds as a safe haven A specific economic point of attention in the runup to the US election will be the stance of the candidates on international trade and the risk of an increasingly protectionist rhetoric What matters however is what happens after the election Should there be protectionist measures there would be a clear negative impact on growth higher inflation and higher bond yields In conclusion the consensus view on growth in the US and the Eurozone and the low level of disagreement give us reasons to be hopeful about the economic outlook However we should pay close attention to the risks and uncertainties They are predominantly negative for growth lower as well as inflation lower as well Importantly some of the alternative scenarios have totally different implications for the evolution of bond yields This would mean that as time goes by and the likelihood of the different alternative scenarios evolves bond yield volatility could be high

Nothing could be less obvious.",economic-research.bnpparibas.com,Monetary anchoring is one of the main arguments put forward by central banks to justify an eponymous digital currency According to supporters of the digital euro a reduction in the use of paper money or even its disappearance would be the natural next step and result in the creation of a digital form of central bank currency that would be the only guaranteed way of keeping the currency anchored in the digital era Nothing could be less obvious In November  during a speech on the digital euro Fabio Panetta then a member of the ECB’s executive board stated “People’s confidence in private money is underpinned by its convertibility on a onetoone basis with the safest form of money in the economy  central bank money the monetary anchor  and hence with other regulated forms of money” He added “Private issuers of currency ie banks editor’s note have to rely on convertibility as their money is exposed to operational credit liquidity and market risks” while also noting that “these risks are reduced through public policy safeguards such as financial supervision capital requirements and deposit insurance” In a recent article also addressing concerns  which they believe to be exaggerated  about bank disintermediation as the result of a digital euro Bindseil Cipollone and Schaaf  posit the theory that the decline in use of banknotes for daily transactions will also eventually reduce the structural demand for banknotes To support their claims they point out that the nominal stock of banknotes decreased in  for the first time since  in the euro area which they attribute to higher interest rates and the digitalisation of payments In the light of the supposed risk of the reduced role as anchor coupled with the fall in banknotes in circulation the ECB needs to ensure that “the money it issues maintains its role as a monetary anchor” But the combination of a reduction in use of banknotes as a payment instrument and a decline in banknotes in circulation does not really stand up to the facts Despite decreased demand for banknotes for retail transactions banknotes outstanding rose by x between  and  while at the same time its relative size increased from around  of household current accounts to  These opposing trends are known as the “paradox of banknotes” Meanwhile cash is still the most frequently used payment method at the point of sale despite the sharp decline in use of cash since the Covid pandemic with  of transactions in terms of the number still paid in cash in  According to ECB estimates demand for banknotes in  was motivated more to keep them as store of value between  and  than to pay for transactions between  and  A large proportion of demand also came from nonEU residents between  and  In any case the quality of anchoring of the commercial bank money to the central bank currency is not measured so much on the basis of the amount of the cash currency in the economy as on the basis of use of the commercial bank currency that is anchored to it Economic agents willingly use the commercial bank currency rather than the central bank currency because they are confident that they will be able to convert deposits held with commercial banks into the central bank currency hence the risk of a bank run when confidence slips And this confidence in the value of the commercial bank money cannot be underpinned by just the deposit guarantee Although this system guarantees reimbursement of a certain amount expressed in the euro unit of account as issued by the central bank  since  in the European Union it does not guarantee in any way that one euro deposited with a commercial bank will always be worth one euro deposited with any other commercial bank and one euro issued by the central bank This guaranteed equal value is ensured only by the ability to convert the commercial bank currency into the central bank currency at parity crossparity of euros from different commercial banks in some way by analogy with cross exchange rates In other words the ability to go to a bank counter or ATM to get cash in exchange for funds deposited with the bank at parity The number of ATMs has been in decline in the eurozone since  but as the ECB stresses the density of ATMS is not the most relevant measure of ease of access to cash The interpretation of this indicator is based on the implied assumption that cash machines’ elimination is distributed uniformly across each country and among its population which is not the actual situation In this regard a recent ECB study states that the proportion of people living within  km of the nearest cash access point in  ranged from  to  in the various countries in the eurozone with a median of  for all countries Furthermore in   of citizens of the eurozone considered it “easy” or “very easy” to access an ATM while just  considered it “very difficult” Furthermore it should be noted that the withdrawal of cash at some merchants cashback sometimes supplements the ATMs in areas with low density levels The ECB is presenting the digital euro as the digital counterpart to coins and banknotes However there is a real risk that consumers will regard it more as a substitute for bank accounts particularly due to the similarity in means of payment and means of holding money between the digital euro and euros held in a commercial bank account which incidentally has been a kind of “digital euro” since the euro was created in  Importantly there is the risk of an increase in the cost of banking resources with the need to replace customer deposits with more expensive refinancing and hence of bank loans We believe that the only characteristics of the digital euro that could stem this risk would be a very low holding limit  comparable to the amount of cash reasonably held by each citizen for transaction purposes a few hundred euros at the very most  or an exclusively “offline” digital euro held in the form of a digital token stored on a mobile phone the loss or theft of which would be final as is the case with cold hard cash According to Aristotle the three functions of money are as a medium of exchange a store of value and a unit of account These three functions which are still relevant today cannot be separated It is up to the user rather than the issuer of the money to decide the main function they want to attribute in practice to each form of money For example we have seen that demand for banknotes was motivated more by the function of money as a store of value rather than as a payment instrument Despite its clear and justified desire to restrict the “digital counterpart of banknotes” to its role as a medium of exchange the ECB would be risking opening up a Pandora’s box and creating a new kind of store of value to rival banknotes and bank deposits to the detriment of financing the economy and financial stability

reduction in interest rate uncertainty to be precise fears of higher rates have disappeared and through an easing of financial conditions Moreover a slide in a recent presentation of Isabel Schnabel of the ECB was entitled “economy is bottoming out as peak of transmission may have been reached” This implies that tight monetary policy should be less of a headwind than before Finally the international environment may also play a positive role EUROZONE ECONOMIC SENTIMENT AND GDP What do the data tell us Many soft data business and household surveys are published earlier than hard data activity demand employment so the historical relationships between the two can be used to gauge whether there is already any evidence pointing in the direction of an improvement of the hard data The European Commission’s economic sentiment index ESI declined slightly in February from  to  Looking at its components industry sentiment recorded a marginal decline Construction and particularly retail trade saw a bigger weakening Consumer sentiment improved but services’ sentiment dropped Taking a slightly longer perspective the ESI after declining for several months reached a low point in September and October last year at  and improved thereafter reaching  in December before weakening in January and again in February As shown in chart  considering that the ESI is still below its longterm average of  there is a risk of negative quarterly real GDP growth On the other hand momentum has been positive the average ESI for the latest  months is higher than for the previous  months An alternative measure consists of comparing the latest reading with that  month earlier Despite its recent softening the February ESI is still higher than the one  months ago so on this measure momentum is still positive Does a better momentum of the survey data point towards a better momentum of real GDP growth If this were the case it would point to better first quarter GDP growth compared to the final quarter of  History tells us that this has tended to be the case when the ESI in the final month of a quarter was higher than at the end of the previous quarter real GDP growth in the same quarter was higher than in the previous quarter in  of cases Considering that real GDP growth qq has been positive in  of cases looking at ESI momentum when estimating quarterly GDP growth should add value EUROZONE MANUFACTURING PMI AND GDP The SP Global purchasing managers’ index PMI is another important survey of business sentiment Momentum defined as the change in the average for the latest  months versus the  previous months has been positive both for the manufacturing and the services sector but one should keep in mind that we are starting from a low base particularly in manufacturing Chart  shows that when the manufacturing PMI drops below  the likelihood of negative quarteronquarter GDP growth increases In this respect the February reading of  is sobering Does PMI momentum help in assessing whether real GDP growth in a given quarter might be higher than in the previous quarter The answer is clearly positive when the manufacturing PMI in the final month of a quarter was higher than its value  months earlier real GDP growth has been higher than in the previous quarter in  of cases Considering the latest value of the manufacturing PMI is well above that in December  versus  it seems likely that the reading in March will be higher than in December implying positive momentum This would point towards a high likelihood of first quarter GDP growth being better than in the previous quarter To conclude when describing the economic outlook it’s tempting to use the metaphor that spring is in the air considering that it’s early March that in terms of activity and demand the last months have resembled an economic winter basically a stagnation of real GDP and that sentiment data have improved in recent months despite the recent weakening of the European Commission’s index However much like the soft winter no recession in the Eurozone spring looks soft as well and the recovery should be very gradual Against this background the evolution of inflation remains key through its impact on households’ confidence and spending power the cost base of companies and most importantly through its influence on the ECB’s guidance and decisions

in recent decades matters from an economic perspective In addition there is a concern about what it means for economic policy and the ability to act swiftly when circumstances require so In the runup to this year’s US presidential election many commentators will inevitably think of the phrase “It’s the economy stupid” coined by James Carville the strategist of Bill Clinton’s campaign in  Economic performance may again matter in the voting behaviour of the electorate on  November but the question is how Will voters look in the rearview mirror at the huge increase in inflation in  and early  and its detrimental impact on purchasing power or will they focus on the big drop in inflation since the latter part of  Will they pay attention to high mortgage rates or will they find comfort in the ongoing strength in the labour market This topic known as ‘economic voting’ has been the subject of intense debate over the past three decades A key question is whether individual economic perceptions are influenced by the political affiliation In such case economic perceptions could influence voting behavior but these perceptions would be ‘coloured’ by the political affiliation of the voters LewisBeck and Martini  analyse whether the voters’ perception of the economy is it improving or weakening is correlated with developments in terms of inflation the equity market and real GDP growth They find that “voters’ retrospective evaluations of the national economy track real changes in the US economy” Adding party identification as an explanatory variable does not significantly improve the regression results This would mean that voters’ perceptions correspond to economic reality However other research shows a partisan bias Households’ inflation expectations are lower when their preferred party controls the White House “During the Barack Obama presidency Republicans had higher inflation expectations than Democrats This partisan gap reversed when Donald Trump was elected When Joe Biden was elected the partisan gap reversed again” Other researchers find based on survey data that people “who affiliate with the party that controls the White House have systematically more optimistic economic expectations than those who affiliate with the party not in control” However there is no evidence that this leads to increased spending The authors conclude that “economic optimism driven by partisan bias reflects ‘cheerleading’ instead of actual expectations of income growth” Other authors come to a different conclusion and find that following presidential elections “consumption increases in areas allied with the winning presidential candidate and decreases in those areas where affiliations lie with the losing candidate” People feeling different about the economy based on party affiliation is a manifestation of political polarization Other examples are extreme differences in views along partisan lines amongst politicians as well as their voters on a broad range of topics people having negative feelings or even disliking members of the other party the socalled affective polarization etc Based on the media coverage of political disagreement about government policy polarization has seen a significant increase after the global financial crisis chart Other indicators show that polarization has been on the rise since the s In theory this could have negative economic consequences due to shorttermism of economic policy ‘myopic policies’ political gridlock making it difficult to enact necessary policies and an increase in policy uncertainty In case of affective political polarization firms could also face risks in their product markets One would expect company investments to be particularly sensitive to these factors Marina Azzimonti  finds a persistent negative relationship between political polarization and aggregate investment This result is confirmed even when controlling for the influence of economic policy uncertainty and the macroeconomic environment She estimates “that about  of the decline in corporate investment between  and  can be attributed to a rise in partisan conflict” Qiaoqiao Zhu analyses this topic at the level of US states and finds that “a one standard deviation increase in political polarization results in a  decline in investment or a  reduction relative to the mean investment rate” Moreover this effect is almost entirely driven by inland firms which lack the mobility to invest across state borders Unsurprisingly there is also a negative impact on employment growth The empirical research can be summarized as follows Firstly certain authors find that households’ economic perceptions are not significantly influenced by partisan affiliation whereas others report that voters who affiliate with the party that controls the White House are more optimistic about the future Secondly there is conflicting evidence whether this upbeat feeling influences spending Thirdly with respect to company investments the conclusion is unambiguous polarization exerts a negative influence This last point is enough a reason to argue that the significant increase in political polarization in the US in

have to undertake a sustained adjustment effort lasting several years Eurozone public budget balance and debt With the Treaty of Maastricht of  an EU economic governance framework was established to coordinate economic policies to achieve the EU’s economic objectives The latter concern the soundness and sustainability of public finances sustainable economic growth and convergence addressing macroeconomic imbalances as well as reforms and investments to enhance growth and resilience A key component of the framework is the Stability and Growth Pact SGP adopted in  and its rules for the monitoring and coordination of national fiscal and economic policies Its preventive arm sets for each EU member state a budgetary target In addition Eurozone countries are also subject to the corrective arm which “ensures that member states adopt appropriate policy responses to correct excessive deficits andor debts by implementing the Excessive Deficit Procedure” Economic convergence and sustainable public finances are important because they bring economic stability and reduce the contagion risk between countries It is crucial in the Eurozone in view of its influence on the transmission of monetary policy Healthy public finances also provide fiscal policy leeway to address the consequences of adverse shocks and avoids that monetary policy would be the only instrument that can be deployed In February  a debate was launched on reviewing EU economic governance On that occasion the European Commission argued that “the surveillance framework has supported the correction of its existing macroeconomic imbalances and the reduction of public debt” and considers that it has also promoted sustained convergence of economic performances and closer fiscal policy coordination in the Eurozone However looking at the Commission estimates for  budget deficits and public debt one is struck by the huge dispersion chart Moreover the Commission also noted that the fiscal stance had often been procyclical and that member states had consistently favoured current expenditures rather than investments Recently an agreement has been reached between representatives of the European Council the European Parliament and the European Commission on a reform of the fiscal rules Reducing debt ratios and deficits should be done “in a gradual realistic sustained and growthfriendly manner while protecting reforms and investment in strategic areas such as digital green social or defence” Member states must submit national mediumterm fiscal structural plans When government debt exceeds  of gross domestic product GDP or where the government deficit exceeds  of GDP the Commission will submit a ‘reference trajectory’ indicating “how member states can ensure that by the end of a fiscal adjustment period of four years government debt is on a plausibly downward trajectory or stays at prudent levels over the mediumterm” The agreement contains two safeguards that the reference trajectory must comply with Under the debt sustainability safeguard the “projected general government debttoGDP ratio decreases by a minimum annual average amount of  percentage point of GDP as long as the general government debttoGDP ratio exceeds  and  percentage point of GDP as long as the general government debttoGDP ratio remains between  and ” To this end a net expenditure path is determined and incorporated in the national mediumterm fiscal structural plans The plans and expenditure paths need to be endorsed by the Council The net expenditure path would be such that it brings the general government deficit below  by the deadline set by the Council The minimum annual structural improvement is set at  of GDP The deficit resilience safeguard requires that fiscal adjustment would continue until a structural resilience margin of  of GDP relative to the  of GDP reference value of the Maastricht Treaty has been built Under this safeguard the annual improvement in the structural primary balance to achieve this margin is set at  of GDP  if the adjustment period has been extended to  yearsFinally a control account set up by the Commission will keep track of the annual and cumulative deviations of net expenditures compared to the target path Under specific circumstances the Council upon a recommendation from the Commission could allow deviations from this path To conclude the new economic governance framework has several key characteristics riskbased surveillance differentiation between member states based on their specific situation the integration of fiscal reform and investment objectives in a mediumterm fiscal plan The single operational indicator in the form of a net expenditure path should facilitate communication and emphasizes the key role of discretionary primary spending rather than tax increases in bringing public finances under control The reference trajectory in combination with the debt safeguard and the deficit resilience safeguard implies that many EU countries will have to undertake a sustained adjustment effort lasting several years

However, its focus on the budget deficit implies that under realistic assumptions, public debt in percent of GDP will decline significantly. Proponents of the golden rule argue that, given the huge investment needs -green and digital transition, public support to innovation, etc.-, any leeway should be used to finance these investments, thereby enhancing structural growth and/or accelerating the green transition.

government was introduced in  following the global financial crisis in order to bring public finances back under control chart It is enshrined in Germany’s Basic Law and its reform or abolition would require a constitutionally amended twothirds majority in the Bundestag It has a structural component which limits net borrowing ie adjusting for financial asset acquisitions and cyclical effects to  of GDP per year and a cyclical component According to the latter the deficit can be bigger during a downturn but this must be compensated when the economy improves again Finally there is an escape clause “which allows the Bundestag to suspend the debt brake by a simple majority in the event of a natural disaster or other extraordinary emergency situations beyond the control of the state” It was the interpretation of this escape clause that on  November last year put the German government in a difficult position because the Federal Constitutional Court declared that “credit authorisations established within the scope of the exception clause can only be used until the end of the relevant financial year and then expire without replacement” This blocked the Federal Government’s plan to use credit authorisations obtained in previous years but not yet used to finance spending in the upcoming years because these authorisations had been declared void This forced it to reduce

sustainability at risk Firstly after the application of the exception clause bringing the structural deficit back to the regular limit could be spread over several years Secondly the annual structural deficit limit would depend on the debt level If the latter is below a certain threshold a higher structural deficit would be permitted Finally the experts propose methodological improvements in the estimation of potential output This matters for the calculation of the structural deficit German Finance Minister Christian Lindner has proposed a reform of the debt brake to enhance fiscal policy flexibility but this should remain neutral in terms of debt dynamics “Additional leeway in times of economic downturn would be balanced by stricter criteria in times of economic upturn” However he is against exempting investments in climate protection from the spending restrictions At the current juncture the debate in Germany boils down to a large degree to the question whether fiscal policy should be based on an iron rule or a golden rule In case of the former strict limits are set and by enshrining them in the Basic Law they impose fiscal discipline on future governments whatever their composition In terms of credibility this has huge benefits considering that in the absence of such an iron rule a commitment of fiscal discipline of the current government is not binding for future governments Proponents of the golden rule argue that given the huge investment needs green and digital transition public support to innovation etc any leeway should be used to that end The GCEE has noted that the debt brake is more restrictive than the European fiscal rules Moreover its focus on the budget deficit implies that under realistic assumptions public debt in percent of GDP will decline Based on various simulations the GCEE concludes that “as a median result the debttoGDP ratio falls below   of GDP by  and to just under   of GDP by  In the long term it converges towards around   of GDP according to the simulation” Aiming for a stabilization at a still low but higher level than these longerterm projections which would require a change to the debt brake would create leeway to finance investments that would enhance structural growth andor accelerate the green transition The outcome of this debate also matters for Europe given Germany’s economic weight

abandonment of the CFA franc with the aim of recovering the flexibility of an unpegged exchange rate regime and greater autonomy of monetary policy is an argument that is either weak in theory or unconvincing in practice even in the short term Monetary sovereignty and foreign exchange sovereignty two sides of the same coin The debate on monetary sovereignty is resurfacing with on the one hand the plan of Argentinian President Javier Milei to dollarise his economy and on the other the temptation of several West African country leaders to abandon the CFA franc Admittedly the motives are very different in nature in the case of Argentina they are purely economic and circumstantial with simple replacement of the peso by the US dollar being according to Javier Milei the only way to radically and sustainably fight outofcontrol inflation that had reached  over a year in March Secondly the motive is political and based on the sovereign principle that currency is a government attribute that cannot be delegated to another country In the case of the CFA franc delegation takes the form of a fixed parity versus the euro and a convertibility guarantee provided by the French Treasury From an economic perspective monetary sovereignty is not limited to delegation of the exchange rate It implies monetary policy freedom ie the free choice for a central bank to raise or lower its key interest rate or to increase or reduce its balance sheet quantitative policy Unfortunately the choice of currency regime constrains monetary policy a fixed currency regime requires the central bank to intervene to avoid permanent deviation of its key policy rate from the key rate of the central bank of the country of the anchor currency or to refrain from implementing a quantitative policy that would lead to a lasting divergence in money market interest rates The choice of currency regime may also constrain budgetary policy in the case of a currency board regime and even more so dollarisation balanced public accounts are a necessary condition to ensure the credibility of fixed parity In the past use of dollarisation or a currency board has proven effective in dampening soaring inflation in the early years of implementation Argentina in  Bulgaria in  Ecuador in  The challenge once inflation is under control is to maintain fiscal discipline and attract productive foreign investment in order to credibly build disinflation and ensure economic growth over the long term Therefore although particularly brutal from a social point of view Javier Milei’s strategy aimed at generating a primary budget surplus and removing capital control as quickly as possible is consistent with the dollarisation plan from an economic point of view And even though the central bank BCRA has cut its key rate since midDecember from  to  currently the aim of the new authorities is not to hope for a recovery in growth through credit They are simply looking for an urgent way to alleviate the increasing public finance cost of the sterilisation operations carried out by the BCRA to contain the inflationary effect of the monetary financing of the budget deficit Monetary policy will remain very significantly constrained by inflation Abandoning exchange rate pegging unconvincing economic arguments in the case of the franc zone REAL EFFECTIVE EXCHANGE RATE OF THE WAEMU AREA Abandoning the peg of the CFA franc raises more questions The primary and neverending argument is that the conditions for an optimal currency area OCA would not be met However meeting all these conditions is so restrictive that this argument has a very limited practical scope Conversely there are two interesting arguments to be discussed the alleged overvaluation of the CFA franc and the slowdown in growth due to the lack of monetary policy flexibility Is this really the case Observation of the real exchange rate of WAEMU countries over a long period shows an appreciation of  compared to  year of devaluation but with three subperiods a trend appreciation between  and  then a trend depreciation between  and  and a stabilisation since then We cannot therefore talk about a clear overvaluation either in terms of level or in terms of dynamics Moreover the BCEAO’s foreign exchange reserves have not reached a critical level as was the case in  Although they have dwindled since  they are still above their statutory limit of  of the BCEAO’s external commitments compared to  at the end of  The review of overvaluation can be refined using modelling approaches In  based on its two principal external imbalance valuation models the IMF estimated according to the method either a slight overvaluation of the CFA franc of  st method or even an undervaluation of  nd method In both cases the spread was small and the IMF concluded that the real exchange rate was in line with the zone’s fundamentals These conclusions are still valid in  WAEMU AREA DOMESTIC BANK CREDIT TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR DEFLATED BY THE CPI INDEX By using a rudimentary general equilibrium model GEM but adapted to developing countries a former World Bank economist and current economic adviser to the United Nations Ali Zafar on the contrary indicated in a recent book on the Franc Zone a strong overvaluation of the real exchange rate for the entire WAEMU zone of  ranging from  to  depending on country However as the author states this result depends heavily on the magnitude of the shock introduced into the model to result in such an overvaluation More specifically using the model for Senegal a termsoftrade shock ratio between international prices in dollars of exports and those of imports of the order of  is required to justify an overvaluation of the order of that calculated by Ali ZafarMoreover the termsoftrade shock still needs to last for several years to justify a devaluation in response to the worsening of fundamental balances budgetary and external balances and this termsoftrade shock still needs to not correct an exceptional improvement in previous years However in the case of Senegal over the past two decades the sharp decline alone of nearly  in cumulative terms from  to  had precisely followed an improvement of  in cumulative terms also from  to  The second argument lack of monetary policy flexibility seems even less wellfounded In real terms credit growth in the private sector of the WAEMU was very rarely less than  pa between  and  compared with real GDP growth of  pa on average Credit growth slowed in  as in most countries but accelerated again from  It remained sustained in  despite the ECB’s monetary tightening In summary the two main economic arguments advocating for monetary sovereignty of the countries of the franc zone flexibility of unpegged exchange rate and flexibility of monetary policy are either weak in theory first argument or unconvincing in practice second argument One development that would make economic sense would be the abandonment of fixed parity versus the euro alone in favour of pegging it to a basket of strong currencies more representative of the structure of foreign trade a development that most economists including Ali Zafar defend On the other hand casting off without a probationary period of stability would be very risky in our opinion as repayment of public and private debts might well not be possible in the event of devaluation As politically legitimate as it may be monetary and foreign exchange sovereignty cannot be decreed it has to be acquired Article completed on  April

published in  but the authorities have increased their level of ambition over the past four years in response to a difficult domestic economic climate and an external environment marked by strong commercial and strategic rivalries particularly with the US In particular industrial policy must contribute to Chinas national security objectives and reduce its dependence on imported materials and

investment in infrastructure is planned in  but at the same time efforts are expected to be made to rationalise local government spending and restructure the debt contracted by their financing vehicles In addition new fiscal and monetary policy measures are being envisaged to stimulate domestic demand and stabilise the property sector but the emphasis on boosting household consumption remains limited in reality In the short term this economic policy risks amplifying the divergence in performance between sectors and the imbalance between domestic demand and supply that has been apparent for several months now On the one hand domestic demand and service sector activity remain subdued still held back by the property sector crisis regulatory uncertainties and the lack of consumer and private investor confidence This sluggishness persisted in Q  Property investment and house sales continued to plummet The recovery in retail sales has seemingly waned and services growth has slowed  yy in Q  vs  in Q  and  over  as a whole  which is only partially due to the unfavourable base effects stemming from the rebound in Q  This loss of momentum contributed to a slight rise in

generally favourable for the Prime Minister Economic growth is expected to exceed  for the fiscal year ending at the end of March and although a slowdown is expected for  it is expected to remain robust buoyed by investments remaining dynamic thanks to rising production capacity utilisation rates and the financial consolidation of companies and banks In addition inflationary pressures have eased over the last twelve months  yy in February even though risks are on the rise due to climate events and geopolitical pressures A more robust banking sector than ten years ago INDIA SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF BANK ASSETS Over the past decade the government has adopted two measures that have helped the banking sector to recover implementing the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in

their debt remained contained at  of GDP and their pretax profits were enough to cover their debt servicing costs  times compared to three times a decade ago However the rising household debt levels should be monitored as households have variablerate debt Nevertheless their overall financial position is still generally good Their financial assets were enough to cover the value of their liabilities  times in March  Major structural challenges remain Despite real improvements over the last five years the country is still facing many structural challenges i public finances are still notable for their high level of debt  of GDP some of the lowest budgetary revenues in Asia which barely exceed  of GDP despite VAT being adopted in  and an interest burden on debt that consumes more than  of revenues and reduces the budgetary leeway for spending on research and development infrastructure education and healthcare ii the structurally low level of FDIs  of GDP in  compared to  in Indonesia and  in Malaysia iii weak governance iv a high exposure to climate risk and v low employment levels Regarding this last point the strong growth in the youth population is often viewed as one of the key drivers of the growth in Indias economy According to UN forecasts the proportion of the working age population  years old is expected to continue rising until the middle of the century compared to China where it has been decreasing since the beginning of the s In  the median age in India was estimated to be just over  years old according to the UN while it stood at  years old in Malaysia  years old in Vietnam  years old in China and  years old in Thailand However India is currently not managing to exploit its demographic advantage Although the employment rate has been rising over the past two years it only stood at  in March  which is still below its prepandemic level  in March  according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy CMIE This low employment level is due to a particularly low levels of activity among women and young people According to the most recent public survey the female participation rate stood at just  while it was  for men The share of young people who are not in a job looking for work or in training is particularly high According to the International Labor Organization ILO it hit  in India in  which is similar to the rate in Indonesia  but well above the prevailing level in other Asian countries  in Malaysia  in Vietnam and  in Thailand The unemployment rate among Indias young people is particularly worrying In December  it likely hit according to the CMIE  for yearolds and  for yearolds while the national average was  in March  The manufacturing sector is still hardly growing One of Narendra Modis stated goals was to make India the new factory in the world by developing its manufacturing sector Despite the measures taken to attract foreign direct investment opening up many sectors to foreign companies and slashing corporate tax rates in  and to boost highly labourintensive sectors through Production Linked Incentive Schemes that have been in place since  the manufacturing industrys share in the countrys valueadded has not increased In fact it has actually decreased slightly It stood at just  during  compared to  in  In addition apart from specific business segments such as cars pharmaceuticals and textiles activity is barely growing in other sectors However industrial development is seemingly essential in order to meet the huge job creation needs The share of employment in the manufacturing sector is still low  of total employment in  according to the most recent survey and has fallen by  percentage points over the last five years By contrast manufacturing employment stood at  in China

get significantly more young people and women into employment and attract more foreign direct investment Without this Indonesia will become an “old” country before it becomes a high income country A new President that follows the same path as the previous one FORECASTS Subianto Prabowo who had already been a presidential candidate in  and  won the presidential elections in February in the first round The future government is expected to follow a similar foreign policy to Joko Widodos government However future President Prabowo is seemingly more ambitious for his country both economically and politically on the international stage The former general who made a point of putting “national security” at the forefront of his campaign is expected to continue his defence spending commitments from his time as Minister of Defence He is also possibly expected to be more receptive to the United States security interests in the region as the United States and Europe are its main arms suppliers At the same time the future President is aspiring to make his country a key economic player in Asia In order do this he will look to attract investments from China its biggest investor behind Singapore and penetrate this market However this “multialignment” could be difficult to sustain should there be standoffs in the South China Sea as Indonesias economic and nationalist objectives would then run counter to each other A strong economy INDONESIA REAL GDP GROWTH IS ROBUST EXCLUDING DURING THE COVID The government which will officially take office next autumn will inherit a strong economy Since  apart from the years of the COVID pandemic economic growth has remained robust and stable It has reached  per year on average over the last ten years excluding the pandemic period In  it is expected to remain dynamic despite slowing down slightly to  before rebounding to  in  once the uncertainties surrounding the change of government have passed In the short term the main risks to the economy are linked to the international environment Inflationary pressures have accelerated slightly since the beginning of  They stood at  yearonyear yy in March  compared to  in January a rate which is still short of the new target set by the monetary authorities   pp since  January  This slight acceleration is mainly due to rising food prices as well as a slight upturn in prices excluding energy and food  yy Even though the rising inflationary pressures are under control the central bank Bank Indonesia raised its policy rates by bps to  at endApril to contain capital outflows The of the Fed postponing its decision to cut its key rates initially expected in June  combined with an uncertain geopolitical environment have led to a  depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar since the start of the year The yield spread between Indonesian and US government bonds narrowed over the first four months of the year INDONESIA LOW CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT Despite the recent downward pressures on the rupiah Indonesia’s external accounts are sound In  after two years of surplus the current account balance fell back into negative territory as a result of a drop in the value of goods exports caused by falling exported commodity prices  for palm oil and  for coal However the current account deficit is still very small standing at  of GDP partly thanks to rising tourism revenue In addition foreign direct investment FDI flows were sufficient to cover the entire current account deficit The deficit is expected to increase slightly over the next three years unless the prices of commodities exported by Indonesia rise sharply thanks to the geopolitical climate However there should still be enough FDI flows to cover the current deficit The recent downward pressures on the rupiah are not a source of risk Despite contracting slightly since the start of the year foreign exchange reserves reached USD  billion in February  ie  months of imports and overwhelmingly covered the external debt repayments that would be falling due over the next  months USD  billion External debt is still low  of GDP Even though the country is still exposed to volatile capital outflows the central bank has enough foreign exchange reserves to contain the depreciation of the rupiah In addition the stock of portfolio investments held by foreign investors is lower than five years ago  of GDP in Q  compared to  in  One of the main risks identified since Subianto Prabowos election is a slip in the fiscal deficit His campaign rhetoric suggested that his fiscal policy could be much less conservative than his predecessors In particular he promised substantial measures for students which will cost an estimated  of GDP even though the country’s fiscal leeway is limited Government receipts are still low  of GDP and interest payments on government debt are consuming  of revenue The government fiscal deficit and debt are moderate standing at  and  of GDP respectively in  but their financing could pose a potential risk The domestic capital markets are still underdeveloped and the country is still structurally dependent on external financing Even though the share of public debt held by foreign investors had plummeted due to the central bank’s policy of purchasing bonds on the primary market over the  period it still stood at  of total debt at the end of  Major challenges for increasing growth In order to achieve the  growth target that Prabawo championed during his election campaign the new government will have to continue and even accelerate the reforms undertaken during the Widodo era In particular it must successfully manage to quickly and fully capitalise on the demographic dividend which will begin to evaporate in the coming decade According to projections by the United Nations UN the share of the working age population will start to decline from  with the working population growth rate falling below the dependent population growth rate From  the dependency ratio will fall below  and economic growth could then slow down before the country successfully manages to significantly increase the populations income levels Since  Indonesia’s real GDP per capita at purchasing power parity has increased by  per year on average For comparison purposes in South Korea during its own demographic dividend period  GDP per capita increased by  per year on average Therefore even though Indonesia managed to reach the upper middleincome group of countries in  and then came back into it in  having fallen out of it during the COVID crisis its economic growth is now relatively modest compared to previous growth rates recorded in the past in other Asian countries This reflects the fact that the country is not fully benefiting from its demographic dividend In order to capitalise on its demographic dividend a country must invest in human capital education and training and adopt economic policies that i promote the extensive use of its labour force in order to respond to the sharp increase in the labour supply and ii aim to attract FDIs However the level of job creation among women and young people remains highly insufficient According to Statistics Indonesia the unemployment rates for  yearolds and  yearolds were  and  respectively in  According to the International Labour Organization the employment rate for women was  in  compared to  among men In addition agriculture is still the sector with the largest share of the countrys employees  in  while the share of employment in the industrial sector has been stable over the last decade standing at  Its a similar case for the industrial sectors value added share which is still small  in  and has not increased in ten years To accelerate the pace of job creation the government must successfully manage to develop the labourintensive industrial sectors which involves attracting more FDIs However FDI inflows in Indonesia which are already structurally weak fell by  pp in  to  of GDP the lowest level recorded in the last five years This low level is due to cyclical factors the drop in global liquidity and uncertainty stemming from the February  elections but also due to Indonesia’s low level of integration into global trade The country’s market shares are low  of global exports and have barely increased over the past twenty years  pp Its governance is still weak it was ranked th out of  countries in  and its working population are inadequately trained According to the OECD  of  yearolds have not attained an upper secondary educational qualification Spending on

average over  stocks collapsed and total investment stagnated  in real terms due to the falling investment in machinery and equipment combined with rising investment in construction and transport infrastructure Net exports of goods and services contributed positively to real GDP growth as a result of a stronger fall in import volumes than in export volumes over the first three quarters of the year followed by exports bouncing back sharply in Q Finally private consumption growth slowed in  to  due to the postCOVID rebound effects fading out inflationary pressures which decreased over the course of the year but were still high and the impact of the contraction in manufacturing activity on employment and wages As a matter of fact the effect of disinflation on purchasing power has been offset in recent months by lower nominal wage growth Meanwhile the unemployment rate has remained very low  at the end of  SINGAPORE ECONOMIC GROWTH IS GETTING BETTER Economic growth will accelerate in  Domestic and external headwinds are easing but have not vanished completely however Moreover there is still a high risk of further trade and financial shocks in the current international environment We are expecting real GDP growth of  yy which is relatively modest compared to the preCOVID period Economic activity has started to improve in recent months aided by the recovery in the

to March  the number of tourists travelling through Singapore Airport  million arrivals departures or transits was up almost  yy but was still  below its  level Private consumption growth could regain momentum by the end of the year Improving labour market conditions should follow the recovery in manufacturing activity and inflation should continue to decline slowly Conversely private demand could

declined during  and core inflation also eased against a backdrop of moderating wage and domestic demand growth However core inflation has settled above  for a few months compared to its average of  in  As a matter of fact the disinflationary trend has recently been curbed by the hike in the rate of the goods and services tax  pp to  in January rising gas and electricity prices as a result of the hike in the carbon tax and the new increase in international oil prices Price hikes for some services are also expected in the very short term Disinflation is then expected to continue in  with the CPI index expected to increase by  on average over the year The Monetary Authority of Singapore MAS quickly tightened its policy in  in response to rising inflation Monetary policy settings were then kept unchanged in  against a backdrop of disinflation and slowing activity Going forward monetary policy easing is not expected before the end of  due to persisting inflationary risks Singapore uses the exchange rate as its monetary policy instrument and not interest rates which is justified by the fact that the high degree of openness of the economy makes it very sensitive to imported inflation Monetary conditions are tightened or eased through increases or decreases in the appreciation target of the nominal effective exchange rate of the Singapore dollar SGD and adjustments in the midpoint

conditions are expected to remain restrictive in the short term The government can prioritise longerterm goals Fiscal policy has been normalizing over the last two years The fiscal balance which had gone into a large deficit during the pandemic has improved rapidly It should return to surplus again from the  fiscal year from April  to March  As a result the government can prioritise longerterm objectives which are as follows i increasing social spending in particular healthcare social housing and training in order to respond to high living costs and increasing demands of an ageing population ii support for digitalising the economy and developing new sectors such as the biomedical and fintech sectors iii investments in infrastructure to adapt to climate change in renewable

its spending Public finances are healthy thanks to strict rules of fiscal discipline that have been followed for a long time Government gross debt is seemingly high  of GDP in  However on the one hand

activity in the Czech Republic and Hungary contracted by  and  respectively In Romania GDP growth nevertheless slowed down markedly in  It was mainly driven by investment while consumption which is

year Economic growth is expected to accelerate over the next two years Consumer spending will benefit from the fall in inflation the expected increase in wages and pensions this year and a relative easing in credit conditions Retail sales and import volumes have already improvedsince the end of  Furthermore if the gain in confidence in industries observed in March European Commission index and PMI index in the manufacturing sector is confirmed industrial production which has remained sluggish in recent months should pick up Public investment will probably be supported by European funds By contrast projections for private investment are mixed this year with projects likely to be postponed while awaiting the forthcoming elections on one hand and the confirmation of the improvement in domestic and foreign demand on the other hand Economic activity will nevertheless be constrained by a cautious monetary policy against a backdrop of strong wage pressures and by a fiscal policy geared towards consolidating public accounts in the years ahead It should be noted however that a degree of fiscal flexibility is expected this year in view of a pivotal election year A cautious monetary policy ahead ROMANIA INFLATION Inflation calculated from the harmonised price index gradually fell to  yy in March  after peaking at  in November  However this figure is well above regional inflation By way of comparison it was  yy in Poland over the same period  in the Czech Republic and even  in Hungary the country with the highest inflation rate in  Headline inflation is mainly driven by core inflation with a contribution of  points The situation has reversed compared to  with food and energy making a marginal contribution this time One point to highlight is that yearonyear core inflation has been higher than headline inflation since July  This is mainly due to strong wage pressures In  the minimum wage was raised twice from  lei to  lei and then to  lei last October Meanwhile wages across all sectors rose by an average of  in  In the short term wage pressures will likely persist in a context where the labour market remains tight with a relatively stable unemployment rate of  over the last twelve months As a result Romania is likely to record the highest inflation rate in the region this year Monetary authorities in Romania have adopted a cautious policy with the key rate being maintained at  since January  In the short term the central bank is likely to move towards monetary easing However it will probably be measured given strong wage pressures alongside with an inflation which is still expected to be well above the official inflation target  this year By comparison Hungary and the Czech Republic have already started their monetary easing cycle The Central Bank of Poland by contrast has returned to a monetary status quo since the end of  after two key rate cuts in September and October A busy election year This years political calendar is packed with the European and local elections followed by the presidential elections first round on  September and second round on  September But the main focus will be on the parliamentary elections scheduled in December The interpretation of opinion polls on the parliamentary elections is premature at this stage but whatever the outcome of the elections the reforms currently under way should continue Romania which has been a member of the European Union since  has made significant progress in terms of convergence GDP per capita at  of the EU average and is pursuing its integration within the EU Indeed it partially joined the Schengen area on  March  The future government will also face serious challenges in terms of both public and external accounts A high current account deficit but partly offset by FDI inflows The current balance is structurally in deficit The deepening in the deficit observed in  and  was led by a deterioration in the energy balance In  it remained at a level well above the preCovid period although it fell slightly due to an easing in commodity prices In the short term the deficit is unlikely to improve significantly due to the expected rise in imports driven by the improvement in consumption and investment The current account deficit has been deteriorating for several years but has largely been covered by capital inflows especially foreign direct investment FDI and European funds In  net FDI inflows covered  of the current account deficit The coverage ratio rises to around  when European funds are included In addition foreign exchange reserves have continued to rise since  reaching EUR  bn in  In the short term the country is an attractive destination for FDI inflows and is benefiting from the reorganisation of production activities by euro zone companies nearshoring Similarly portfolio flows EUR  bn in  should be supported by relatively high yields in the region Excessive deficit procedure likely to continue ROMANIA GOVERNMENT DEBT AND FISCAL DEFICIT Since  Romania has been under an excessive deficit procedure by the European Commission due to the permanent spending measures introduced by the government in  which has increased the budget deficit The successive shocks to the Romanian economy have worsened this deficit since  In  the deficit remained significant even though it fell very slightly to  of GDP compared with  in   in  and  in  Last year the increase in the tax rate for certain companies and the end of tax breaks for certain sectors helped to contain the deficit The pension reforms introduced in November  are designed to bring pensions back onto a sustainable path in the medium term However this will also lead to an increase in pensions of around  in  Similarly largescale consolidation measures are likely to be limited this year given the large number of elections to be held As a result the budget deficit is likely to be around  of GDP this year which means that Romania will inevitably remain under the excessive deficit procedure The escape clause which allowed EU Member States to deviate temporarily from the Stability and Growth Pact during the Covid pandemic expired in December  However financing the budget deficit is not a major problem due to the inflow of European funds and a certain resilience of foreign demand for domestic debt Public debt is sustainable in the short to medium term and is not expected to exceed  of GDP over the next five years Fiscal consolidation could accelerate after the elections given Romanias commitments under EUs Stability and Growth Pact In the short term broadening the tax base is a priority especially as tax revenues as a share of GDP are structurally low  of GDP in Romania in  compared with  in Poland and  in the Czech Republic Despite an increase in funding costs on bond markets over the last two years the interest burden on the debt expressed as a percentage of tax revenues was contained at  in  One point of caution concerns the size of the governments foreign

feared a year ago Moreover the accounts published by the Ministry of Finance are on an accrual basis and not on a cash basis These accounts consider expenditure commitments for  whether disbursed or

 These reserves had been eroded over the first three months of the year not due to a deterioration in the balance of payments but as a result of stronger demand for dollars from residents and a reduction in the position of fx swaps of the commercial banks with the Central Bank In February and in cumulative terms over  months the current balance deficit fell to USD  billion  of GDP a division by two compared to its peak in spring  This improvement can only be explained by a lower deficit in the balance of “gold  energy items which shrank from  to  of GDP However the trade balance of other products the trade balance of services dominated by tourism revenues which reached USD  billion over  months and the trade balance of revenues aggregated still show a major surplus The expected decline in the errors  omissions item was offset by the surplus of the balance of portfolio investments On the other hand in Q  residents deposits covered by the currency risk protection mechanism KKM were predominantly transferred to dollar deposits despite the rise in interest rates on deposits in TRY In midApril the equivalent of USD  billion remained in deposits not yet transferred and

three years activity indicators in the first quarter performed much better than expected in the wake of its rebound last December the leading indicator of GDP IBCBr continued to rise in January and

have a significant impact on GDP growth Consumption has been the driving force behind the economic recovery backstopped by higher transfers and the solid performance of employment The labour market has yet to show signs of slowing down  defying expectations In seasonally adjusted terms unemployment retreated slightly in the first quarter while average income in real terms continued to rise th consecutive month of increase in February These favourable developments explain the solid growth in retail sales as well as that of service activities The reading of certain indicators did however cast some doubt over the strength of economic activity considering the declines in industrial production and consumer confidence in January and February as well as the relative slowdown in export

market recorded nearly USD  bn in net capital outflows from nonresidents Multifaceted budget support BRAZIL CONTRIBUTIONS TO REAL GDP GROWTH PERCENTAGE POINTS The solid performance of activity in Q has led us to revise our GDP growth forecast upwards for this year  vs  previously The stronger start to the year has in particular been a welcomed development for public accounts the government recorded a surplus of BRL  bn in tax revenues compared to initial forecasts over the first two months of the year This additional boost is expected to help the government achieve the primary balance

positionned to both invest and absorb the cost associated with a rise in oil prices to keep prices low at the pump Slower than expected rate cuts BRAZIL POLICY RATE VS REALIZED AND EXPECTED INFLATION Despite the cumulative  basis point rate cut since August  and the cuts to come this year monetary policy is likely to remain in restrictive territory  at least as long as private operators mediumterm inflation expectations remain above the BCBs target The governments ambiguity with regard to its budgetary objectives and Lulas renewed interference in certain large companies are weighing on expectations but also on the currency  which in addition has suffered from a strengthening dollar The weakening of the currency and its effect on imported inflation the escalation of geopolitical tensions and their effects on commodity prices as well as slower monetary easing in advanced economies are constraining the reaction function of the Brazilian monetary authorities These considerations in addition to local factors are slowing down the disinflationary process eg prolonged effect of El Nio on food prices accelerating inflation in the service sector persistence of wage pressures and a rate of unemployment below the NAIRU rate In view of this context and in order to give itself greater room to manoeuvre in the coming months the BCB has shortened the horizon during which it provides indications on the future direction of its monetary policy forward guidance It announced a further halfpoint cut to the SELIC rate at the next meeting in May without however vocalizing its position beyond that Market participants have thereby adjusted their expectations and are now anticipating smaller rate cuts in the second half of the year The change in the profile of the BCBs monetary policy council COPOM at the end of the year Lula appointing the new governor in particular should through its effects on inflation expectations be another point of vigilance for the markets in H Brazil in the spotlight Brazil holds the rotating presidency of the G and will hold its annual summit in November  in Rio de Janeiro A year later the country will host the UN Climate Change Conference COP  in Belem in the Amazon In addition to issues surrounding the decarbonization of economies the main themes likely to occupy the agenda include the fight against poverty and inequality the reform of

increasing demand for Chilean mining products mainly copper and lithium as well as green hydrogen However the risks are still on the downside In particular political tensions could result in continued stalemates over reforms and could hurt consumer and investor sentiment A period of reforms CHILE INFLATION AND POLICY RATE Since coming into office in March  President Boric and his government have been vocal about their desire to introduce a large number of reforms A number of bills have been introduced most notably on pensionsystem reform and accelerating the energy transition but the various Constitutional bills have been the main focus of political debates The rejection of two proposed new Constitutions the first which was supported by the government but viewed as too progressive was rejected by  of the votes in the referendum on  September  and the second which conversely was viewed as too conservative and was denounced by the government was rejected by  of the votes in the referendum on  December  is emblematic of the polarised political climate in the country and the difficulties faced by both the government and the opposition parties By mutual agreement the draft constitution is being put on hold for a number of years as a result the current Constitution shall continue to apply for the time being so that political debates can focus on other areas Political pressures are expected to remain high over the coming months and further difficulties could arise for the government there are high expectations from the public but the President and the government are unpopular while the opposition parties have a majority in the Senate which has already restricted the governments efforts to introduce reforms since coming into office What’s more the government does not have long to push ahead with its key reforms before political discussions are monopolised by the local and regional elections October  followed by the general elections presidential and parliamentary elections in November  First of all a second version of the fiscal reform the first was rejected in March  was tabled in Congress in January  This new version proposes an increase in tax revenue of nearly  of GDP by  compared to  of GDP in the first bill achieved almost exclusively through reinforced measures to enforce tax payment compliance whereas the initial bill planned to increase income and wealth taxes The additional revenue is expected to be used to finance further social spending meaning that this spending will only have a marginal effect on public finances The bill is currently being debated in the Senate and these debates are turning out to be heated At the same time the draft reform of the pension system which mainly sets out to improve the replacement rate and coverage initially tabled in mid was approved by the Chamber of Deputies the lower house of the National Congress of Chile in January  after many amendments were made to the original bill This bill is now being discussed in the Senate and its scope could be further reduced The increase to the minimum oldage pension approved by elected representatives is unlikely to be under threat Conversely the creation of a public administrative agency resulting in the role of AFPs Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones the administrations responsible for managing pension funds being scaled back to simply financial management over pensions approved by elected members of the lower chamber could be reconsidered during senators’ discussions In addition while the government has already had to accept that the revenue linked to the new employer contribution of  of an employee’s salary cannot be fully used to strengthen the solidarity pillar the Senate could decide that the revenue can only go into individual accounts Finally discussions about the energy transition framework law are continuing In April  the government tabled a particularly ambitious National Lithium Strategy in Congress aimed at improving national lithium production efficiency including bringing Chilean companies into the lithium value chain and increasing tax revenue while establishing a “socially and ecologically” sustainable framework At the end of March  the government stated that lithium mining at the “strategic” salt flats of Atacama the only one in operation for the time being and Maricunga would be undertaken via publicprivate partnerships majorityowned by the State Five other salt flats may be mined under publicprivate partnerships and finally  other salt flats accounting for less than  of the country’s total production will be opened to private companies Slower than expected fiscal consolidation CHILE BUDGET DEFICIT AND PUBLIC DEBT Against this backdrop the fiscal consolidation targets set by the government to reach a balanced budget in  seem optimistic After a surplus in  of  of GDP the fiscal balance was once again in the red in  with a deficit of  of GDP as the increase in revenue from lithium mining was not enough to offset the effects of lower activity and falling copper prices Revenue was down almost  yy in total At the same time spending increased by almost  yy Over the next two years we expect a slight decline in the fiscal deficit despite activity recovering public pressure on increasing social spending is unlikely to dissipate Nevertheless even if fiscal consolidation is slower than the authorities are expecting sovereign risk is still limited Public debt has increased significantly in recent years but is still moderate standing at  of GDP compared to  of GDP in  Debt is expected to continue rising gradually over the next few years but its profile is still good Debt maturity is still higher than  years and contingent debt remains low which is

Dubai around  of the UAEs GDP the dynamic services sector is expected to drive growth to around  of GDP The logistics and transport sectors and to a lesser extent retail were the primary growth drivers in  In the short term the outlook for the nonhydrocarbon sectors is positive Residential real estate is expected to continue growing despite an expected slowdown in Dubai given the rapid construction rate seen since  More broadly the UAEs attractiveness to tourists and foreign investors is supporting the real estate sector For example the visa system has recently been relaxed and foreign investors are now allowed to hold up to  of the capital of a company registered in the United Arab Emirates Tourist numbers are expected to continue growing albeit at a slower pace than in  This is because the spike in the number of visitors in   in Dubai was partially as a result of COP being held in the country The shortterm outlook for the oil sector is more mixed Although there are some signs of global oil demand recovering OPEC countries will be cautious before easing the restrictive quota policy We expect oil production in the UAE to increase by around  in  Overall growth is expected to hit  in  and accelerate to  in  thanks to the expected increase in oil production in particular Potential risks to growth UAE REAL GDP GROWTH Oil market developments still have a major impact on activity despite the country having a diversified economy compared to the rest of the region In recent years the increase in oil production capacity across North and South America has restricted the cartels influence on the oil market which may limit the increase in production quotas for OPEC countries Interest rates being kept high in the United States is another constraint as the Central Bank of the UAE has to follow the Feds monetary policy due to the Emirati dirham being pegged to the US dollar Although the Fed is expected to start cutting rates this year this will likely be done at a moderate pace given the buoyant economic activity in the United States The geopolitical environment may have serious adverse repercussions for the United Arab Emirates given the size of the services sector which is traditionally more sensitive to political risk than industry and the UAEs dependence on maritime trade routes If the Strait of Hormuz were to be blockaded this would severely limit oil export capacity Indeed the pipeline connecting Abu Dhabis oil fields to the Port of Fujairah has a capacity of  mbd while exports average  mbd However disruption to shipping traffic in the Red Sea has hardly affected oil exports as Asia is by far the largest export market Therefore paradoxically the increased geopolitical risk may positively impact activity in the UAE and Dubai in particular which is home to nationals from countries that have come under geopolitical tensions in recent years Robust public and external finances Public and external liquidity and solvency indicators are robust at the consolidated level Nonhydrocarbon budget revenue accounts for approximately  of total government revenue It comes from taxes and dividends from governmentowned companies On the other hand government spending is growing at a moderate pace Against this backdrop the fiscal breakeven oil price per barrel is below USD b generating a surplus in the public accounts Government debt is low  of GDP in  and is decreasing The government net asset position is confortable given that the assets held by sovereign funds are worth at least twice the GDP The contingent debt of the seven Emirates defined as the contingent debt of nonbanking governmentrelated entities in which the government holds a majority stake is high  of Abu Dhabis GDP and  of Dubais GDP but it does not pose a systemic risk The UAE in the lowcarbon transition UAE CRUDE OIL PRODUCTION Reliance on hydrocarbons revenue from hydrocarbons accounts for about  of export revenue excluding reexports and  of government revenue is exacerbating the uncertainties around the lowcarbon transition There is a twofold risk at play On the one hand hydrocarbon assets could lose their value and become stranded assets and therefore stop generating enough revenue for the economies in question while on the other hand the economic diversification may remain unsufficient While many countries have a lowcarbon transition as a goal its pace and economic implications are currently very uncertain Nevertheless for oil producers the risk of facing serious economic difficulties in a relatively short period of time two decades is not negligible according to the IMF Against this backdrop the UAE is developing a twopronged strategy continuing to make optimum use of its hydrocarbon resources by increasing its production capacity and preparing for the posthydrocarbon era by accelerating the diversification of its economy Unlike other producers in the region the UAE is aiming to increase its oil production capacity in the medium term It is currently estimated to stand at just over  mbd and the country is targeting  mbd by  At the same time gas extraction is expected to increase so that the country becomes a net gas exporter by  Currently part of the UAEs domestic consumption is covered by imports from Qatar At the same time the targets for decarbonising the energy mix are ambitious On the one

energy is included  of the electricity mix The country has major renewable energy ambitions which only involves solar energy given the features of its climate aiming to triple its production capacity between  and  The challenge of diversifying exports The energy transition adds a new dimension to the process of economic diversification For more than twenty years diversifying Gulf economies has mainly been about creating jobs by developing the private sector As highlighted in the IMF report the energy transition involves another diversification as these economies will now have to diversify their exports given falling income from hydrocarbons Up until now diversification has mainly been concentrated in sectors with limited productivity tourism or in nonexportable goods sectors real estate and has not been seen in many sectors involving exportable high valueadded goods or services with the exception of logistics and energyintensive industrial sectors such as petrochemicals and aluminium The UAE has a number of key assets that it can leverage in order to implement this new diversification Substantial financial resources will enable the Federation to invest internationally in renewable energies Masdar or to hold stakes in innovative companies In addition its research and development expenditure are somewhat higher than the rest of the region standing at around  of GDP on average between  and  compared to less than  for the other Gulf countries Nevertheless the UAE is facing stiff international competition in its willingness to develop new export sectors particularly around trying to attract innovative companies and skilled labour For exemple in the artificial intelligence AI sector considerable resources are being deployed to increase the capacities of data centres which are essential for developing the AI sector Growth in this sector is currently still too small to have a real economic impact Overall even though the UAE seems best placed within the region to implement the second wave of diversification and while it is too soon to measure its effects there are still major uncertainties around whether it can keep up its current level of economic development within the lowcarbon transition Article completed on  April

logistical difficulties will persist and prevent a more dynamic upturn in activity On the demand side investment and the rebound in consumption should support economic growth after two quarters of

upper target  but in March  it still stood at  yy The disinflation process will still be slow and uneven in the coming months inflation is not expected to return to its preferential target  until the

growth and inflation figures were better than expected but the latest drought in the country undermines its economic recovery Regional instability is another real risk to bear in mind However the countrys adequate economic policy management and solid fundamentals remain supportive factors of macroeconomic stability FORECASTS Faced with an accumulation of shocks over the past five years the Moroccan economy is holding up well The authorities are maintaining a prudent economic policy that willnot jeopardise the stabilisation seen in the countrys economy since the Covid crisis Most encouragingly they have also sought to learn from these events by launching ambitious reforms such as the development programme for the Marrakech region hit by an earthquake in September  which goes far beyond reconstruction In addition this year will once again see measures implemented to strengthen the social safety net starting with introducing monthly direct support for disadvantaged families or continuing to expand social security coverage The headwinds are still strong In addition to regional instability Morocco is once again under water stress and the resulting drop in agricultural production will adversely affect economic growth However the good macroeconomic fundamentals will help the economy to navigate through this further period of turbulence largely unscathed Externalaccount stability is not under threat MOROCCO EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS The dynamics of external accounts are not raising any major concerns After widening to  of GDP in  the current account deficit

resilient to external shocks Car production has almost tripled over the last ten years or so hitting  units last year making the sector the countrys leading export source  between  and  Combined with the boom in other industrial niche markets such as electronics and aeronautics this sustained development has reduced the economys vulnerability to fluctuating terms of trade and to the demand from its main trading partners Morocco has continued to increase its market share on the European continent Despite a rise in imports due to increased investment and rising food needs as a result of the

thanks to a complete overhaul of the subsidy system which will both absorb the increased cost of introducing direct support for households and reduce the inherent volatility of this budget item The lack of tension on the global gas market which makes up the bulk of the expenses incurred by the subsidy system is conducive to the implementation of this socially sensitive reform Increased use of

is not very sensitive to external risks Furthermore monetary tightening remained moderate which enabled interest cost to be kept at under  of budgetary revenue Yet there is not much evidence to

significant In February  the consumer price index CPI was only up  yearonyear compared to a peak of  at the start of  The main reason for this trend is falling food inflation see chart  However the slowdown in inflation has been widespread with the CPI excluding food up only  in February This decline in inflation is validating the cautious strategy of the monetary authorities which waited until September  to start hiking rates and only doing so moderately by  bp in total At  the key rate was below inflation for a long time but this is no longer the case Therefore questions could be raised about easing However a number of factors suggest that the status quo will prevail this year In particular the announced increase in butane gas prices and the fall in agricultural production will create inflationary pressures in the coming months The impact should be modest Average inflation is expected to stand at  in  compared to  in  However while the risk is not under control the central bank will remain vigilant Against a backdrop of a high interestrate differential between Europe and Morocco the countrys financial attractiveness should also be maintained especially for the Moroccan diaspora which accounts for a major percentage of bank deposits  Finally given that investment is beginning to increase again the economy is seemingly coping with the current monetary conditions A

for the sustained investment effort to continue to mask given the now high level of debt Political context between relief and caution FORECASTS The swearingin of the new President Bassirou Diomaye Faye on  April marked the end of an electoral process that had been unprecedented in more ways than one At  he is the youngest President elected to lead the country For the first time the outgoing President Macky Sall was not standing for another term Never since the country became independent has an opposition candidate succeeded in being elected at the first ballot With  of the vote against  for Amadou Ba the governments candidate Mr Diomaye Faye therefore has a solid mandate even if the lack of a majority in the National Assembly is likely to force him to seek alliances before a possible dissolution Little known with no elective mandate and still in prison two weeks before the election Mr Diomaye Faye owes his meteoric rise largely to the defeat of his mentor Ousmane Sonko who was disqualified because of a judicial conviction His victory also reflects the populations support for a breakaway programme characterised among other things by a strengthening of economic sovereignty It envisages strong measures such as reforming the CFA franc or even abandoning it and renegotiating oil and gas contracts production of which is due to start this year The election was closely followed by the international community After weeks of political crisis triggered by the outgoing President’s decision to postpone the elections in a region marked by a succession of coups over the past three years the solidity of Senegals democratic institutions has once again reassured its main partners The  basis point bp fall in year risk premiums on international sovereign bonds since the announcement of the results also attests to investors relief In addition to the easing of the political climate the softening in the rhetoric of Mr Diomaye Faye and his movement in the runup to the elections suggests that economic policy is likely to be more tame particularly on the issue of the CFA franc where the authorities now seem to favour a communitybased approach The formation of the government also reflects the delicate balance to be struck between the desire for change and the need to provide some reassurance Unsurprisingly Ousmane Sonko was appointed Prime Minister of a tightlyknit team of twentyfive ministers many of whom are senior members of the presidential camp Nevertheless expertise seems to have prevailed in the allocation of key posts as in the case of the new Finance Minister Cheikh Diba who until now has held the post of Director of Budget Planning in the same ministry However caution is still called for There is little budgetary leeway to implement the project given that the country is committed to an IMF support programme and is heavily in debt The working relationship stemming from the unprecedented pairing of a substitute candidate turned President and a Prime Minister leader of the political movement could also prove difficult Yet the challenges facing the authorities are immense commensurate with the hopes of the population Economic growth high but poorly diversified REAL GDP GROWTH One of the main challenges will be to put the Senegalese economy on a more solid and above all more inclusive growth path At first glance this may seem paradoxical for a country that is emerging from a year cycle of growth in excess of  and for which the outlook is for real GDP growth of  in  thanks to the startup of oil and gas production However the impact of hydrocarbon development on the rest of the economy should not be overestimated particularly in terms of employment Aside from the revenue generated by the sector the economy could ultimately benefit from a reduction in energy costs as a result of the substitution of imported oil by locally produced gas However this transition will require substantial investment the outcome of which remains uncertain In any case it will take time Whats more the boost to real GDP from oil and gas production is only likely to be temporary From  onwards growth is expected to fall back to  driven almost exclusively by nonhydrocarbon activities This is far from a foregone conclusion SENEGAL PUBLIC FINANCE INDICATORS The COVID crisis followed by the shock of the war in Ukraine highlighted some of the limits of Senegals development model The country has held up fairly well overall but economic growth between  and  slowed more than the average for other WAEMU countries and oilimporting economies in subSaharan Africa see chart  Inflationary pressures were also stronger in   in Senegal compared with  for the rest of the WAEMU In fact Senegal was unable to take advantage of the favourable context of the prepandemic period to transform itself The service sector still dominates around  of GDP but remains dominated by low valueadded activities while agriculture accounts for only  of GDP For a sector that employs  of the working population the limited weight of agriculture reflects above all its low productivity A similar observation can be made for the secondary sector where exports are not very diversified apart from the boom in precious metals gold titanium and zircon In the absence of productivity gains stemming from a sectoral recomposition  the growth of the Senegalese economy has heavily relied on capital accumulation The investment rate rose from  in  to over  in  a dynamic that is striking in terms of its scale and level By comparison it reached  in Cte dIvoire where the growth rate is higher In Senegal a high proportion of investment seems to have been channelled into the construction sector the effects of which on economic activity are shortlived In addition this investment effort has resulted in increased pressure on public finances particularly debt and hence a high degree of sensitivity to the various shocks since  A large part of the Senegalese economys underperformance in  is therefore due to the contraction in public investment in real terms a situation that could recur given the fragility of the current macroeconomic situation Persistent macroeconomic imbalances In spite of strengthening exports on the back of the boom in the hydrocarbon sector Senegal will continue to record current account deficits According to the IMF they are likely to remain close to  of GDP after peaking at almost  of GDP on average between  and  due to the huge import requirements for capital goods associated with the initial phases of development of the oil and gas fields The delay in launching hydrocarbon exports explains why the current account deficit is still expected to be  of GDP in  At first sight it would appear that future external financing needs current account deficit and amortisation of external debt would be well covered But this assumes that Senegal continues to receive financial support from the international community According to the IMF just over half of total external capital flows over the next  to  years should be made up of FDI which is significant but leaves a gap that is difficult to fill solely by issuing eurobond debt Furthermore the Senegalese economy is a net debtor in key areas of trade particularly foodstuffs It will therefore remain vulnerable to the vagaries of the international economic situation Public finances are not really any stronger Major infrastructure projects carried out during President Salls two terms in office and the various shocks recorded between  and  have resulted in a significant increase in debt At  of GDP Senegalese government debt is now  points higher than the average for WAEMU countries On the positive side its structure is favourable Despite increased recourse to localregional capital markets for financing in recent years  of the stock of debt is still held by bimultilateral creditors As a result the interest burden remains at a moderate level Nevertheless it is tending to increase rapidly  of government revenue compared with  in  and  in  Moreover the increase in nominal GDP linked to the startup of hydrocarbon production should improve the debt ratio which will remain high  of GDP at the end of  see chart  Continued fiscal consolidation therefore remains essential The previous administrations objective was to reduce the budget deficit from  of GDP in  to  in  then  in  To achieve this it was counting largely on a gradual reduction in energy subsidies whose surge in  had prompted the authorities to make cuts in public investment This reform of the subsidy system also features prominently in the IMFs support programme However there is nothing to suggest that the new authorities will continue along this path in which case further adjustments will certainly be required given that hydrocarbon revenues are not expected to exceed  of GDP The IMFs next review is therefore likely to attract particular attention from

were  lower than normal across the entire country but there were still very substantial disparities between regions Even though there was an overall slight rise in the numbers of kharif crops planted compared to normal this was still well down from the previous year In addition El Nio could increase temperatures in Q  and adversely affect the current year’s crops The Ministry of Agriculture  Farmers Welfare currently estimates that grain harvests could be less than half of the previous year’s Poor harvests would on the one hand adversely affect raw material prices and therefore household purchasing power and on the other hand farmers’ incomes This is important as the agricultural sector alone accounted for  of employment in  The second risk which is contingent on the first risk

prices which make up  of the household consumption basket However price rises remained below the target set by the monetary authorities   pp and core inflation excluding food and energy prices continued to ease falling to  yy in December The RBI is therefore expected to keep its key policy rates unchanged during the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meetings However if food prices were to remain firmly stuck at high levels this could delay the monetary easing expected in Q  The third risk is linked to the international environment There are high geopolitical risks to global growth and any downward revision of global growth by  pp would lead to a drop in Indian growth of  bp In addition India is still vulnerable to oilprice rises even though this risk is much milder than before as

the investment rate in volume has hit  of GDP over the past decade which is ahead of other Asian countries However almost  of the investments were made by households mainly in their housing Government investment in infrastructure accounted for just  of the total investment and investment in machinery and capital goods made up only  of the total investment Nevertheless for nearly two years private and public investments have accelerated substantially especially because banks’ and companies’ financial positions have strengthened In  the investment rate rose by  pp to hit  of GDP a level which had not been seen since  and this positive trend continued during the first half of FY It is also likely to resume during the third quarter of the current fiscal year in view of the business lending

Malaysian economy are still moderate The first area to monitor worth mentioning is the property market In fact sales volumes declined in the second half of  and prices rose by just  yy in Q  compared to an average of  in the first half of  The second area to monitor in connection with the first relates to the financial positions of households and companies particularly in the construction sector

which is  pp more than over the  period with this proportion standing at  for companies in the construction sector The final two areas of concern are related to the performance ofpublic finance and pressures on external accounts A modest consolidation of public finances MALAYSIA PRESSURES ON EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS The government has limited room for manoeuvre in order to support economic growth The country’s fiscal base which is already modest shrank in  and is expected to continue falling in  due to declining oilrelated revenues The government is still not planning to reintroduce the goods and services tax which would however increase the tax base and reduce its dependence on oil revenues In  the deficit is expected to remain high albeit slightly lower than last year It should hit  of GDP compared to  of GDP in  which is above the average recorded over the  period  of GDP Total revenues are expected to fall by  pp to  of GDP due to the sharp fall in commodity prices On a positive note the burden of interest payments on debt fell slightly accounting for  of government revenues over the first three quarters of  compared to  for the same period in the previous year In its  budget the

rise in the service tax rate which will be accompanied by measures to expand its base The government also intends to introduce taxes on luxury goods and capital gains However these increases will not be enough to offset the expected drop in dividends received from the national oil company Petronas  of GDP According to government forecasts revenues will fall to  of GDP which is  pp below the average recorded over the  period On the expenditure side a pp cut is planned The government intends to reduce subsidies  of GDP but the savings made will be used to finance targeted social spending for the most in need In reality the reduction in the deficit will essentially mirror the cuts to investment spending which had risen sharply in  as a result of paying MDB’s debt If this onetime expense is excluded expenditure is expected to be relatively stable in  In  government debt increased by  pp to hit  of GDP compared to  of GDP at the end of  However the debt structure still does not pose a great deal of risk as it is denominated in domestic currency and held by resident investors Increased pressure on the ringgit During  downward pressures on the currencies of emerging countries

out of all Asian currencies In nominal and real effective terms the ringgit depreciated by  and  respectively against the currencies of its main partners’ countries This muted depreciation was due to

FDI inflows increase slightly Therefore there are grounds to question how much Malaysia could be challenged by Vietnam According to national data from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority MIDA investment projects in Malaysia are currently still performing well particularly in the electrical and electronics sector Malaysia could benefit from some of the relocation of production plants

accelerating steadily to hit  yy in Q buoyed by tax incentives to households and the strong labour market performance Trends across other components were more mixed as private investment grew at a

pace than anticipated In  Thailand welcomed just over  million tourists which is more than  up on  but still  down on  By nationality trends have not really altered from the preCovid period thanks to special measures introduced by the Thai government such as the temporary visa exemption for visitors from India Taiwan and Kazakhstan and incentives for extended trips by offering discounts on a number of services such as accommodation hospitality healthcare and domestic flights On the other hand the number of tourists from China is only creeping up very slowly Travel bans for Chinese nationals were gradually lifted during  but government subsidies to promote domestic tourism likely put a dampener on the recovery in international travel The total number of Chinese tourists in  was

being driven by household consumption which has been buoyed by an expansionary fiscal policy and the gradual return of tourists according to the Bank of Thailands estimates the  level should only be hit by the end of  However the effects of El Nio are difficult to measure and Thailand may not be able to take full advantage of the upturn in global growth and the increased demand for electronic components due to the countrys structural difficulties the political climate weak investment and a lack of infrastructure are inhibiting the competitiveness of the export sector In particular weakerthananticipated Chinese growth is expected to hit Thai growth hard THAILAND THE CENTRAL BANK PAUSES MONETARY TIGHTENING On the monetary side favourable base effects and the largerthananticipated drop in energy and unprocessed foodstuff prices led to a rapid deceleration in inflation during the year The yearonyear rate of inflation has even been in negative territory since October standing at  yy in December Core inflation also eased during the year but is still slightly above its preCovid average standing at  yy in December The Bank of Thailand hiked its key rate most recently in September to  after a cumulative increase of more than  basis points since August  and is expected to hold it steady during the months ahead It is anticipating slightly higher inflation in  in view of the upward pressure on energy and agricultural prices Inflation is expected to be kept within the target range between  and  however A new political landscape Political instability is still a major concern However the recent elections and the subsequent formation of the new government point to a changing political landscape The decadeslong hostility between generally speaking the royal and military elite and the rural population is slowly giving way to hostility between new parties looking to reform the country mainly supported by younger voters and parties who want to maintain the status quo The results of the general election which was held as planned last May are a good illustration of this The opposition parties won a majority in the House of Representatives with more than  seats out of  and the two main opposition parties alone won nearly all of these seats Move Forward the party offering the greatest societal transformation including an amendment to the countrys lsemajest laws and a reform of the military won  seats while the Pheu Thai Party PTP won  seats Although it had formed a coalition of eight parties representing more than  of the votes Move Forward was not able to form a government After several weeks of discussions at the start of July party leader Pita Limjareonrats bid to become Prime Minister failed as he failed to get votes from the Senate According to the constitution in force since  a Prime Ministerial candidate needs to win a majority of votes in the National Assembly made up of the House of Representatives  seats and the Senate  seats whose members are all appointed by the King in consultation with the military Therefore in order to get the  votes required to obtain a majority alliances needed to be formed with the conservative parties and in particular the approval of the outgoing military government had to be won At the end of August Sretta Thavisin the candidate from the PTP was appointed Prime Minister heading up a large coalition made up of eleven parties including two promilitary parties after the National Assembly and the King gave their approval The political climate is expected to remain tense in the months ahead as the Move Forward party was ultimately left out in the cold and the party has had to respond to a number of accusations that it is looking to ultimately overturn the monarchy using its proposal to amend the countrys lsemajest laws as an initial step on this journey If the party were to be dissolved large numbers of mass demonstrations would likely follow In addition when it comes down to it the coalition government is made up of the PTP and ten other parties including conservative parties who all have greatly conflicting economic and political agendas meaning that delivering policy embraced by all of these parties could be tricky On the other hand on a positive note the need for consensus in order to implement reforms should prevent fiscal slippages However in the medium term the PTP and all of the coalition parties have declared that they intend to honour the previous governments commitments in particular by introducing measures aimed at making the country more competitive The Thailand  industrial strategy and investment incentives both domestic and foreign thanks to the Investment Promotion Strategy which is planned to run from  to  are therefore expected to continue All of the parties also supported measures to accelerate the energy transition Extrabudgetary spending in  As part of this process Thailands lawmakers started to scrutinise the

hand opposition parties primarily Move Forward heavily criticised the proposed budget a lack of clear objectives and reforms modelled on reforms introduced by the previous government and on the other hand because the proposed budget does not include the flagship economic measure the digital wallet announced last November This measure will set out to distribute  baht around  euros to over  million people based on a number of criteria such as age and income This measure would cost the equivalent of at least  of GDP The government recently secured the Privy Council of Thailands approval to

policies of its authorities to create a favourable regulatory environment for FDI and to sign free trade agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for TransPacific Partnership and

Argentina emerging from the crisis without debt restructuring Javier Milei’s victory in the presidential election last October and the announcements of very radical economic policy measures since he took office on  December suggest a particularly difficult  for the Argentine economy Shock therapy FORECASTS Just a few days after he was sworn into office the president signed a decree containing  changes aiming to stabilise the economy the socalled “Necessity and Urgency Decree” DNU which has been in force since  December The stabilisation plan is mainly built around  balancing the budget from  through spending cuts of  and an increase in revenue of  of GDP and  devaluing the official exchange rate against the dollar from  to  pesos combined with temporarily hiking import taxes from  to  and export taxes with the introduction of a minimum rate of  ARGENTINA ACTIVITY INDICATORS On  December President Milei tabled an omnibus bill containing  articles to the National Congress These articles supplement the DNU but are not urgent measures and instead have a much broader aim focusing on mass privatisation deregulating a number of sectors and easing labour market rules Javier Milei has sought to delegate legislative powers to the executive for a renewable year period so that he could pass his measures without Congress’ approval The latest IMF review viewed the fiscal measures favourably even though the devaluation of the peso will be accompanied by accelerating inflation The country is expected to receive an additional USD  billion from the Fund before the end of January The Argentine financial markets also reacted positively as the spread between the official exchange rate and parallel exchange rates bluechip swap rate MEP which came down from  to  with the devaluation has stabilised since the announcements The Central Bank of Argentina’s foreign exchange reserves have increased by USD  billion since Milei took office Stagflation intensifies ARGENTINA EXCHANGE RATE  OFFICIAL FX RESERVES However the DNU has already been challenged on a number of occasions before the courts with unions arguing that the measures are unconstitutional particularly the labour market reform measures At the same time Milei would like to see the bill passed quickly by the National Congress but his party does not have a majority in either the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate and the support of small rightwing parties is not enough Milei is locked in a very unpredictable standoff with the deputies Public hostility was also expressed through a general strike on  January The political and social risk has therefore skyrocketed and is likely to reignite financial instability In the short term the measures will lead to more severe stagflation than was anticipated before the elections Industrial production and construction activity have been declining since  and exports have been in freefall since  as a result of the drought that has hit agricultural exports hard see chart Real GDP is expected to have fallen by an annual average of  in  Agricultural production should recover sharply in  thanks to record harvests following several years of drought However in other sectors the slump will simply deepen following the inflationary shock of the devaluation of the peso Before the devaluation inflation was already skyrocketing  per month on average between August and November compared to  between January and July despite priceincrease controls introduced by the previous government In December inflation came in at  over one month and  over one year with the devaluation and the end of price controls triggering a catchup wave particularly around fuel prices  over one month and food prices  over one month Inflation will remain very high during the first half of  as the catchup will continue according to JP Morgan’s calculations so far only  of the monetary devaluation has been passed on and regulated prices which account for  of the consumer basket will rise sharply as a result of the subsidy cuts The monthly inflation rate is forecasted to average about  In the second half of  if the depreciation of the exchange rate is contained at  per month official target inflation could fall below  However this can only happen if moneybased inflation disappears Therefore much will depend on the credibility of the budgetary targets on whether these targets are met and on the replenishment of foreign exchange reserves New public debt restructuring on the horizon  The governments financial situation is still precarious For  as a whole the new administration is forecasting a primary deficit of  of GDP which is a rise of  point of GDP compared to  In view of the interest burden of  the total deficit is expected to stand at  of GDP However according to calculations by GlobalSource Partners the Central Bank of Argentina BCRA saw its own interest burden double to almost  of GDP in  pushing the public deficit up to  of GDP As a matter of fact the direct advances to the Treasury and indirect purchases of government securities monetary financing of the budget deficit forced the BCRA to issue sterilisation bonds day LELIQ amounting to up to an equivalent of  of GDP at an interest rate that rose from  at the end of  to  until  December Reducing the BCRA’s liabilities is a government priority Since November LELIQS whose stock only accounted for  of GDP at the end of December have no longer been issued and have been replaced by reverse repos At the same time the key policy rate was lowered to  Nevertheless the interest burden for the BCRA will remain very high Even if the government manages to balance its books and contain the debt burden which has spilled over into the BCRA debt burden it will face a liquidity problem on both domestic and external debt Repayments of domestic debt denominated in pesos including debt indexed on inflation and the exchange rate represent the equivalent of USD  billion Fortunately  of this debt is held by governmentowned banks Therefore a meeting was organised at the start of January at the behest of the Economy Minister and the Secretary of Finance with representatives from the major banks to discuss postponing the  repayment deadlines It should be noted that the previous Economy Minister Sergio Massa had already imposed a postponement of the  repayment deadlines on banks at the end of  External debt repayments interest and principal amount to USD  billion for  USD  billion for the IMF USD  billion for other official creditors and USD  billion for private creditors with two significant falls in January and July In addition to this there is also the trade debt accumulated by importers to their suppliers in  because they were unable to obtain dollars This debt was valued at USD  billion at the end of  The payment of USD  billion by the IMF should cover the debts falling due in January  However foreign exchange reserves only amount to USD  billion and are even negative in net terms ie minus the banks’ reserve requirements and the swap line with the Central Bank of the Peoples Republic of China In addition the Argentine government has been ordered to pay compensation of USD  billion to creditors adversely affected during the nationalisation of the oil company YPF in  As things stand international debt issuance is not an option The government is being forced to issue domestic bonds denominated in dollars to settle importers’ commercial debt However demand is low as the interest rate offered  does not remotely cover the risk At the end of December  federal government debt stood at USD  billion including USD  billion in foreign currency mostly in dollars Following the December devaluation the debt ratio is equivalent to  of GDP and foreign exchange reserves only cover one tenth of the foreign currency debt It seems inevitable that domestic public debt repayments in  will have to be reprofiled With the support of the IMF the government could

hand industrial production fell below its preCovid level in November and fell across all sectors New car registrations on the decline since last April have continued their downward trend  in  On the other hand household purchase intentions for durable goods in the coming months and the household confidence index have improved The increase in real wages in the manufacturing sector which has turned positive since last August  yy in August  in September and  in October argues in favour of a rebound in consumption Economic growth prospects are expected to improve in  but should remain modest

January  and in particular since September so that Hungary is now posting a lower figure than Central European countries Last December inflation stood at  yy compared to  yy in the Czech Republic  in

an increase in government spending The budget deficit would have been more pronounced without the fiscal consolidation efforts since summer  which included the introduction of a tax on exceptional profits and the removal of price caps on fuel in  and on foodstuffs in  In  the deficit is expected to reach  of GDP compared to the  forecast pencilled in the budget Government interest payments estimated at  of GDP  in  have increased significantly and are now among the highest in the EU This surge is primarily attributable to interest paid on inflationlinked bonds In addition the extension of energy subsidies pension hikes  in  plus the supplement paid to pensioners have weighed on expenditure The participation in certain companies has resulted in exceptional disbursements And lastly the authorities have funded some projects that were supposed to be financed by European funds suspended by Brussels For  the authorities are predicting a less pronounced deficit than last year but

vulnerability While Serbia’s admission to the EU is still being hindered by predominantly political factors its economic performance has been strong both in terms of external accounts and public finances Limited impact of the war in Ukraine SERBIA The gradual severing of ties between Europe and Russia has not led to any major economic difficulties in the Western Balkans in particular thanks to a limited dependency on gas imports Slovenia and Montenegro and diversified energysupply sources development of LNG terminals in Croatia and low dependency on Russian gas in North Macedonia In theory the country most exposed to the supply risk is still Serbia due to its dependency on Russian gas imports which account for  of its gas imports In June  the Serbian government secured its imports on favourable terms by renewing its supply contract with Russia for three years Beyond energy issues the war in Ukraine has severely disrupted commodity markets and capital flows Part of the Balkans is particularly sensitive to any shortfall in its balance of payments given that most local currencies are pegged to the euro Croatia and Slovenia are members of the euro area and public debt and bank balance sheets are being significantly euroised Even though the link with the single currency can take various forms from a managed exchange rate policy in Serbia to a de facto euroisation of the economy in Kosovo in order to ensure that the foreign exchange regime remains credible countries must hold sufficient foreigncurrency liquidity to be able to cope with any deterioration in the balance of payments Unsurprisingly the current account deficit increased in  rising on average from  to  of GDP While the Western Balkan countries came into the crisis with satisfactory levels of foreigncurrency liquidity their financing needs have been covered by buoyant foreign direct investment as is the case in Serbia Montenegro and North Macedonia as well as by the support of multilateral lenders Serbia and North Macedonia Impact of Europe’s economic slowdown offset by domestic demand REAL GDP GROWTH The vulnerability to Europe’s economy can take various forms as the European Union is the largest export market for goods the main source of tourists and the main destination for expatriates who contribute significantly to local activity through remittances In  the economic slowdown in Europe  in the euro area and  in Germany had contrasting effects on activity On average exports of goods and services slowed sharply during the first three quarters However household consumption remained sustained thanks in particular to real wage growth in Slovenia Serbia and Croatia against a backdrop of receding inflationary pressures For all of the countries inflation is expected to fall from  on average in  to  in  according to European Commission forecasts Investment was the other main growth driver in  buoyed in particular by foreign direct investment and EU funding According to European Commission forecasts growth should reach  on average across the entire area In Slovenia activity is expected to be slower  expected due to the floods that hit the country hard during summer  About  of the country’s municipalities were affected by this climatic event and the direct damage is estimated at around  of GDP according to the European Commission In  average growth is expected to barely accelerate at all rising to just  against a backdrop of a fragile economic recovery in the euro area  expected Croatia eurozone accession  saw Croatia join the euro area By removing the foreign exchange risk Croatia’s eurozone membership significantly reduces specific risks associated with the high share of government debt denominated in foreign currencies  of the total mostly in euros and the euroisation of around  of bank balance sheets In addition both adopting the euro and joining the Schengen Area is expected to benefit the tourism accommodation sector Tourism is a key sector of the Croatian economy as it contributes to around a quarter of its GDP compared to less than  on average in the European Union In  annual tourist numbers were almost back at their prepandemic levels The size of the tourism sector within the economy reduces some risks in particular the risk of energyprice volatility on activity but increases others including the risk of dependency on the European economy In the longer term the rising temperatures and drought risk expected to affect the entire Mediterranean region will adversely impact tourist numbers and the availability of some resources such as water Public finances are sound and with accounts being kept practically balanced in  and  this will help to reduce the government debt ratio which is expected to be below  of GDP in  Significant financial support is being provided by the European Union and this should help the country to gradually catch up with the European standard In  Croatia’s GDP per capita was  of the European Union average  in  By  it is estimated that Croatia which has a high capacity to absorb European funding could receive European support funds equivalent to a quarter of its current GDP Serbia sound economic fundamentals SERBIA FISCAL BALANCE AND INTEREST PAYMENT Over the past two years Serbia has been evolving in a complex political environment This is because on top of the recurring regional tensions there have also been the consequences of its close partnership with Russia which have damaged its relations with the European Union These factors may hinder the country’s integration into the European Union However from an economic perspective its fundamentals are still sound and will help it to cope with any external shocks Given the significant euroisation of bank balance sheets and government debt the Serbian economy’s ability to generate sufficient foreign currency is a key factor in the country’s macroeconomic stability In practice the foreign exchange policy focuses on keeping the dinar stable against the euro and has resulted in interventions in the foreign exchange market by the National Bank of Serbia Due to a recurring and rather high current account deficit  of GDP on average over the  period and a large external debt amortisation  of GDP on average over the  period the country has a substantial financing need This is being covered by net foreign direct investment which has covered an average of  of the current account deficit since  and by external debt flows Despite a much higher risk premium than before the war in Ukraine broke out  bps currently compared to less than  bps before March  Serbia is still issuing sovereign bonds on international markets USD  bn issued in  In addition the Serbian government’s compliance with the IMF’s requirements has resulted in

government revenue this year and remain very high next year While reaching an agreement with the IMF should provide a solution for the balance of payments crisis at least in the short term the government restructuring domestic debt is becoming an increasingly likely scenario Slowing activity and moderating inflation FORECASTS Economic activity has slowed sharply since  Real GDP rose  during the  fiscal year FY compared to  in  and only increased by  yy in Q FY continuing a downturn that began in Q FY The main factors driving this slowdown are the balance of payments crisis and its ramifications on foreign currency availability and cost as well as inflation The resurging geopolitical risk in the region should reinforce this negative trend in the short term The recent threats to safe maritime transportation in the Red Sea have reduced traffic on the Suez Canal around  of GDP by more than  since the start of this year In addition this deteriorating political environment in the region could negatively impact tourist numbers In the energy sector gas production was down for a second year in   and this fall in production is expected to continue in  More broadly high inflation and interest rates as well as the shortterm uncertainties around the exchange rate will continue to constrain household consumption and corporate investment In total we are anticipating  growth in real GDP in FY A potential rebound next year still depends above all on the geopolitical risk in the region and particularly on the beginning of the stabilisation of the macroeconomic situation under the IMFs supervision At this stage the visibility on each of these two factors is very limited The fall in inflation in yearonyear terms which began last September is not expected to continue this year In December  prices were up  in yearonyear terms down from the high of  in September However a number of price hikes electricity urban transport and internet are coming into force at the start of this year and will fuel service price rises In addition an agreement with the IMF will very likely result in a significant downward adjustment of the exchange rate and therefore in additional inflationary pressures On average inflation is expected to hit  in FY before falling to around  in FY Persisting pressures on the pound According to the most recent figures available the current account deficit continued to decrease in Q FY Over a rolling year this deficit is equivalent to around  of GDP Positive developments concern exports of nonhydrocarbon goods high tourism revenues in  tourist numbers hit an alltime high of  million visitors and revenues from the Suez Canal By contrast the fall in private transfers linked to the widening gap between the official exchange rate and the parallel exchange rate and the decline in hydrocarbon exports hit foreign exchange revenue hard In addition it should be noted that the improvement in the current account is strongly linked to the decline in goods imports due to the constraints on access to foreign currency In the short term geopolitical factors will hurt tourism and revenue from the Suez Canal which account for  and  of foreign exchange revenue respectively In addition the persisting wide gap between the official and parallel exchange rates will continue to adversely affect remittances which in a normal year account for more than a third of foreign exchange revenue Finally hydrocarbon export revenues are not expected to improve This is because on the one hand Egypt is increasingly struggling to generate an exportable gas surplus as a result of sustained consumption and lower production On the other hand according to our central scenario oil and LNG prices in Europe should not rise significantly during the first half of  For several months the issue of covering the external financing need current deficit plus amortisation of foreign currency debt has been relying on the resumption of the IMF financial support and the bilateral and multilateral financing that rely on it which was suspended at the start of  and is subject to the implementation of specific economic reforms Throughout  Egypt faces a huge debt wall in foreign currency This is because according to the Central Bank of Egypt the amortisation of external debt mainly due from public creditors and excluding deposits from the Gulf states in the Central Bank of Egypt amounts to USD  billion in H  and USD  billion in H  The total external debt service amortisation and interest amounts to around USD  billion for  as a whole According to our estimates the combination of international support the amount of support from the IMF will very likely be higher than the USD  billion originally planned FDI flows including revenue from privatisations and an additional increase in the net external liabilities of commercial banks should help Egypt to cover its foreign currency financing need and fuel an increase in the Central Bank of Egypts foreign exchange reserves In FY whether the external financing need can be covered will depend on Egypts capacity to tap the international bond market and on the return of portfolio investments Portfolio investments are relying on the restoration of foreign currency liquidity and on the effectiveness of the policy to curb inflation However the recent exclusion of Egypt from an international benchmark bond index will negatively impact foreign investment inflows into the local debt market In the medium term a persistent sizeable current account deficit and dependence on volatile sources of financing will keep the pressure on the pound and foreign currency liquidity An increasingly unsustainable debt service While we believe that the foreign currency liquidity crisis can be managed in the short term the public finance situation is seemingly becoming increasingly unsustainable due to the alarming levels of some indicators Despite the persistent high budget deficits up until now the governments financing needs have been covered thanks to the high level of local bank liquidity around  of the governments outstanding debt is in local currency and greater access to external financing sources The lingering balance of payments crisis has led to a sharp depreciation of the pound by around  against the USD in  and a huge rise in central bank interest rates  bp since March  in response to the surge in inflation Public finances are very sensitive to these two variables due to in particular the steady rise in foreign currency public debt which increased from  of GDP in FY to  in FY and the short maturities of domestic debt During the first five months of FY  of local debt issues had a maturity of less than one year And for the time being as long as inflationary pressures remain high and foreign currency liquidity remains tight there is very little scope for exploring extending the maturity on local government debt issues With this in mind the ratio of government debt interest payments to total government revenue is expected to reach an alltime high in FY This ratio which measures the affordability of debt for the government hit  in FY which was already one of the highest among emerging economies According to the budgetary figures for the first half of FY debt interest payments hit  of GDP Over the entire year they are expected to increase to around  of GDP According to our estimates the debt interest paymentstorevenue ratio could rise to  in FY and is expected to remain very high in FY This is because the macroeconomic adjustment that will be attached to the IMF support is expected to result in further exchange rate depreciation and domestic interest rates increase therefore causing a further rise in debt service The monetary policy committee rose its benchmark interest rate by  bps on st February The difference between the official exchange rate and the exchange rate on derivative market NDF m is  against the USD The debt burden is clearly unsustainable and is drastically reducing the budgetary leeway Although fiscal performance in the first half of the year was relatively good tax revenues were up  yy this is partly due to an expansion of the tax base but certainly also to the automatic effect of rising inflation on budgetary revenues The prospects of slowing growth and a struggle to find further budget revenue streams set against a backdrop of falling household disposable income may further reduce the governments budgetary leeway On the expenditure side there is not much scope for cuts Social welfare expenditure and wages account for approximately  of total primary expenditure

out IMF agreement in  seems unlikely FORECASTS Tunisia is walking a tightrope without a real safety net This is expected to be the case once again in  The presidential elections held in the autumn have reduced the prospect of an agreement with the IMF reaching this agreement would however help unblock most bilateral and multilateral assistance programmes The IMFs assistance remains conditional on implementation of reforms that President Saed has largely rejected due to a social cost considered too high restructuring of public companies overhaul of the subsidy system Officially discussions have not broken off and new terms taking into account the concerns of the Tunisian authorities could contribute to reconciling positions But this scenario seems unlikely Any agreement with the IMF will require budgetary efforts which are all the more difficult to implement since the very low participation rate in the local elections in December is evidence of latent grassroots dissatisfaction The stability of the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank BCT in  probably also reinforced the authorities idea that the economy could do without financial support from the IMF Considering this years significant financing needs this strategy is nevertheless risky Public finance very high financing risk TUNISIA GOVERNMENT FINANCING NEEDS Despite the dissipation of the termsoftrade shock

of spending By way of comparison this item represented  of spending on average between  and  Further slippages should not be precluded bearing in mind the volatility of global commodity prices Added to this is the increase in interest costs which have exceeded  of budget expenditure for the first time since early  The debt burden is the result of an accumulation of high budget deficits and increased recourse to domestic financing on terms less favourable than those granted by official external creditors However this trend is not set to reverse Unless the budget deficit narrows more than expected the Tunisian governments financing needs will exceed  of GDP this year see Chart  Debt amortization will count for twothirds of this amount This is huge and incommensurate with the prepandemic situation when financing needs were around  of GDP The authorities ability to cope with this remains very uncertain In fact  of the financing plan included in the budget is based on external resources of which only onethird have been identified The government is counting on official external financial support but the repeated budgetary underperformances of recent years call for caution At the end of September  the government had succeeded in mobilising only  of the external resources planned in the initial budget Without an agreement with the IMF such a scenario is therefore likely to recur leaving a gap of  of GDP to be covered in a shallow domestic bond market Standing at  at the end of  banks exposure to the public sector in the broad sense corporates and government rose at the end of  to  of the assets of the entire system Moreover the overall volume of bank refinancing with the Central Bank increased by  in  of which more than onethird in the form of open market operations compared to less than  in  However a minority of these open market operations are used for monetary policy purposes In other words the monetary authorities are indirectly refinancing the government by buying back treasury bills on the interbank market Measures to allow the Central Bank to directly finance the government are even being developed which could potentially have a significant impact on inflation or exchange rates Liquidity risk is not the only source of concern With debt now reaching  of GDP and an inexorably increasing interest burden  of income in  compared to  in  the governments solvency is also deteriorating dangerously The country is now considered as just one step away from payment default by Fitch and Moodys rating agencies Fragile improvement in external accounts After a difficult  pressure on foreign exchange reserves has eased considerably thanks to very good tourism activity high remittances from the Tunisian diaspora and the fall in prices of the main commodities imported From USD  billion over the first nine months of  the current account deficit narrowed to USD  billion in  According to our estimates it is not expected to exceed  of GDP over the whole year compared to  in  The BCT has been able to build up some of its foreign exchange reserves USD  million At USD  billion they now cover  months of imports of goods and services GS External accounts remain fragile The outlook is for a moderate deterioration of the current account deficit to  of GDP in  But the significant weight of the energy imbalance in the trade

external debt amortization USD  billion compared to USD  billion in  However funding sources outside official assistance are largely insufficient Net FDI flows are low around USD  million for the last four years ie less than  of GDP and they will probably stay low in the coming months due to the countrys macroeconomic difficulties With fiveyear sovereign risk premiums still exceeding  bps Tunisia will not be able to turn to the international financial markets either to issue debt Should downside risks increase in the current deficit insufficient financing materialise foreign exchange reserves could as a result fall below the threemonth alert threshold for GS imports with as a corollary strong pressure on the dinar Another factor illustrates the current vulnerabilities the emergence of shortages of subsidised base products since  the import and marketing of which are handled by increasingly indebted public companies The result is a compression of imports which may ease pressure on foreign exchange reserves for some time but this situation cannot last in the long term Economic growth no recovery in sight TUNISIA SECTOR CONTRIBUTION TO GDP GROWTH Against this backdrop it is

breakthrough has recently been made in the process of restructuring the Ethiopian governments external debt The peace agreement between the federal authorities and the Tigray rebel forces signed in

agreements with all of its external creditors in order to fully restructure its debt Before this it must negotiate with the IMF in order to obtain its financial support in exchange for undertaking tough reforms which will primarily set out to strengthen the countrys external accounts This is all happening against the backdrop of ongoing conflicts in the region which are jeopardising the country’s relations with its international partners A slow restructuring process FORECASTS In February  staring down the barrel of an increasingly likely default the Ethiopian government requested a debt restructuring under the G Common Framework At that time external liquidity was falling to critically low levels On top of the falling coffee prices a third of Ethiopias exports over the past decade the country had also been hit by the Covid pandemic and the ongoing historic drought in the Horn of Africa since  However the civil war that broke out in the country in November  derailed the negotiation process and led to its relations with foreign donors being cut off Official development assistance ODA on which the country has been historically dependent shrank by  between  and  plummeting to USD  bn a decade low As a result the foreign exchange shortage intensified and foreign exchange reserves gradually fell to USD  bn in June  covering less than one month of imports The signing of the peace agreements between the federal government and the Tigray Peoples Liberation Front TPLF in November  was a breakthrough moment in this situation Ethiopia reached interim agreements on suspending its bilateral debt service for the  and  fiscal years first in August  with China which holds  of its bilateral debt and then last November with all of its other bilateral creditors As a result interest payments will be deferred until  with the payment of the principal postponed until  coming to a combined total of USD  bn ETHIOPIA EXTERNAL PUBLIC DEBT BY CREDITOR AS OF SEPTEMBER  Beyond the shortterm external liquidity relief these agreements enabled the Common Framework to be relaunched after a long spell of inactivity In order to comply with this mechanism two weeks after it signed the bilateral agreements the Ethiopian government did not pay a USD  mn coupon owed on its outstanding Eurobond debt in order to uphold the principle of comparability of treatment between creditors As a result SP and Fitch downgraded the government rating to default last month The country is the latest in a line of African governments that have defaulted on their external commercial debt since the Covid pandemic following in the footsteps of Zambia and Ghana However unlike these other two countries Ethiopias default is the culmination of a temporary external liquidity crisis rather than a longterm insolvency issue According to the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance in September  public debt was contained at  of GDP compared to  in Ghana and  in Zambia when they defaulted respectively Furthermore less than a quarter of the external debt was owed to private creditors Therefore the negotiations could be faster Firstly the scope of the restructuring will not include domestic debt as was the case in Ghana In addition the restructuring is expected to be limited to extending maturities with the aim of spreading repayments better over time and therefore reducing periods of liquidity pressure Any such agreement should be relatively easier to negotiate with bilateral creditors especially with China which has traditionally been reluctant to accept debt writeoffs However as is often the case Eurobond debt will be more difficult to restructure as evidenced by the failure by the government and private bondholders to reach an initial agreement at the end of October Fortunately Ethiopia has issued only one Eurobond for an amount of USD  bn ie only  of the scope of the debt to be restructured  Which will hinge on tough reforms Nevertheless any further progress under the G Common Framework is still dependent on securing a USD  bn IMF funding programme which would unlock a similar amount from the World Bank The Ethiopian government does not have much room for manoeuvre in negotiating the conditions for this funding without an agreement with the IMF by the end of the first quarter of  bilateral creditors reserve the right to cancel their debt service suspension Yet the IMF will demand tough reforms from the Ethiopian authorities which the government has delayed for many years The main sticking point in the negotiations is the gradual devaluation of the exchange rate a reform launched under the previous IMF programme in  but ultimately abandoned in  For decades the National Bank of Ethiopia NBE has been managing the exchange rate and the Birr has been largely overvalued Due to the foreign exchange shortage the disparity between the official rate and the parallel market rate has gradually widened to nearly  at present ETHIOPIA STRONG INFLATIONARY PRESSURES Devaluation with the aim of bringing the official and parallel rates back together will be needed for the NBE to end the restricted access to the dollar at least  of currency transactions are thought to be carried out on the parallel market and liberalise the foreign exchange regime The scale of the devaluation is being discussed by the Ethiopian government and the IMF as a full correction of the overvaluation would obviously have a significant impact on inflation which is already very high with the yearonyear rise in consumer prices exceeding  since June  Therefore if the foreign exchange market were to be liberalised this would need to go hand in hand with a reform of monetary policy in order to better control inflation via the interest rate channel At the present time the NBEs main measures to tackle inflation involve capping bank credit growth at  for the current fiscal year and reducing the NBEs direct advances to the government ie reducing the monetisation of the fiscal deficit However the end of direct advances will be difficult in view of the governments substantial shortterm financing needs and its struggles to find revenue According to the IMF the Ethiopian governments fiscal revenue gradually declined from  of GDP in  to  in  one of the lowest ratios in subSaharan Africa Over the same period spending contracted at a slower pace so much so that the budget deficit widened to  of GDP in  In order to get public finances on a more sustainable footing and show goodwill to the IMF the government will therefore have to propose fiscal reforms aiming to structurally increase revenue while drastically reducing subsidies and social transfers which accounted for more than half of budgetary expenditure in  Further reforms will be needed in order to durably attract foreign investment and strengthen external accounts Other actions that may be required to secure the IMF financing include developing and liberalising the financial sector continuing the programme to privatise public companies and improving the business environment  And be threatened by ongoing conflicts in the region Despite its estimated death toll of  people which has made the Ethiopian civil war the deadliest conflict in the last twenty years the signing of the peace agreements between the federal government and the TPLF has not halted the ethnopolitical conflicts that are tearing the country apart While the situation is still tense in Tigray the insurgent movements in the neighbouring regions of Oromia and Amhara have grown in recent months against the backdrop of territorial disputes and calls for selfdetermination The United States and the European Union which announced the resumption of ODA to Ethiopia in H  expressed their concern about the escalation of violence and reiterated that their financial assistance programmes remained conditional on the peace agreements being honoured The resurgence of conflicts could also hold up the debt restructuring process On the external side tensions between Ethiopia and its neighbours have also intensified in recent months In December  the trilateral negotiations with Egypt and Sudan around the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam once again failed Ethiopia which expects the dam to produce  MW of electricity in the future has refused to negotiate an agreement on sharing water resources which Egypt has described as a violation of the  Declaration of Principles In addition at the start of January the Ethiopian government signed an agreement with the selfdeclared Republic of Somaliland to recognise its sovereignty in exchange for a port access on the Red Sea and a military base on the coast Ethiopia which has been a landlocked country since the secession of Eritrea in  sees  of its trade transit through Djibouti for an annual payment of USD  bn Somalia supported by Egypt immediately denounced the violation of its sovereignty as Somalilands sovereignty claim has no international

years consumers have dealt with sharply rising prices This year most companies expect that their pricing strategies will return to their prepandemic approaches thanks to stabilizing commodity prices

April according to Department of Labor data On Tuesday a day before the monthly CPI report Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that inflation is falling more slowly than expected which likely means the central bank wont be cutting interest rates anytime soon Making matters worse many consumers have run through the savings they accumulated during the pandemic when they were

Columbia Business School economics professor Brett House Regardless of whether inflation is slowing amongst those goods even with lower inflation prices remain very high and people get a daily reminder of that Bigbox giant Walmart said last Thursday that shoppers are prioritizing buying food and healthrelated items over general merchandise like home goods and electronics The retailer has reported that trend for several quarters now Finance chief John David Rainey told CNBC that Walmarts grocery business has gotten a boost from the widening gap between restaurant prices and the cost of cooking at home Lowerincome consumers are struggling more than other demographics They couldnt save as much during the pandemic and evidence suggests that theyve exhausted those savings according to

Air Lines the most profitable US carrier said in an interview in April Delta and its rival United last month each forecast earnings ahead of analysts estimates for the second quarter Both carriers offer sprawling global networks and have benefited from a rebound in international travel in the wake of the pandemic particularly to Europe and popular destinations in Asia for US travelers like Japan Both carriers have predicted record summer travel demand Those airline trends align with a broader consumer shift that started after pandemic lockdowns spending more money on experiences rather than apparel or electronics Were still spending disproportionately on activities and services rather than on goods House said A Delta Airlines Boeing ER is seen at Owen Roberts International Airport GCM in George Town Cayman Islands on February   Daniel Slim  AFP  Getty Images Delta and United are also capitalizing on travelers who have been willing to pay up for more expensive seats like first class or premium economy US airlines have been racing to add more highpriced seating to their planes and grow lounges for top spenders Inflation hasnt hurt highincome consumers as much as it has the budgetconscious giving them more room to spend Higherincome consumers have also bolstered fastcasual restaurant chains like Chipotle that come in at a slightly higher price point than the cheapest options The burrito chains samestore sales grew  during the first quarter fueled by a  increase in foot traffic Chipotle has a strong perception of value among diners CEO Brian Niccol said on the companys conference call Executives have also previously emphasized that most of its customers come from higherincome brackets Even Walmart have been attracting consumers with deeper pockets As customers pay more for groceries the discounter has attracted more affluent customers and stolen market share from rivals like Target  which has historically been more popular with wealthier shoppers

article M KSS JWN Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Signage of Macys Kohls and Nordstrom retail stores Getty Images Department stores are aging — and so are their customers For more than a century the stores won over multiple generations with a promise to sell shoppers a wide variety of everything For many millennial and Gen Z consumers that hasnt been enough — especially as they discover items on social media and specialty retailers bigbox stores and online players steal away sales Department stores like Macys  Kohls and Nordstrom face an existential crisis as they try to persuade investors to bet on their futures while sales slow and their core customers age Harsh scrutiny from Wall Street has contributed to a fresh attempt by Nordstrom to take the company private and a bid by activist investors to take over Macys and turn it into a private company Kohls too has been the target of activist investors in the past few years Oliver Chen a retail analyst at TD Cowen said attracting younger customers has become more urgent since the retailers have lost so much ground already When youre a department store you need to — and you should — be catering to younger and older he said Customer data illustrates the challenge for the retailers At Kohls  of customers are baby boomers according to Numerator a market research firm that tracks retail trends and sales patterns with a panel of  US consumers thats balanced to represent the population At Macys more than a third of customers —  — are boomers Macys data includes just its namesake stores and website not Bloomingdales and beauty chain Bluemercury Baby boomers are age  or older according to Numerators definition The firm defines Gen X as between ages  and  Numerator puts millennials in the age  to  range and Gen Z between  and  since it only collects data from consumers  or older Nordstrom is the only one of the three that has a larger base of millennial and Gen X shoppers than baby boomers with boomers accounting for  of its customer base Its customer data includes both its namesake stores and its offprice retail chain Nordstrom Rack which has been known to draw in younger fashionforward customers hunting for deals All three department stores have announced plans to woo new customers — including younger ones Yet they have shared weak outlooks for the fiscal year calling for little if any yearoveryear sales growth Chen said the retailers are paying more attention to the problem since Macys and Kohls both have new CEOs and all three are trying to improve their private brands The lines can help a retailer stand out because they are exclusive and often priced lower than national brands Aging customers arent department stores only hurdle The chains like other retailers have struggled with foot traffic and sales as consumers spend less on clothing bedding and other discretionary items while more of their money goes toward everyday items because of inflation Beauty is one of the rare discretionary categories where shoppers have been splurging despite inflation Kohls has leaned in by opening more Sephora shops inside of its stores Melissa Repko  CNBC To attract younger shoppers Kohls is adding trendier clothing for teens opening more Sephora shops and bulking up its baby department In an interview with CNBC in late March CEO Tom Kingsbury said department stores including Kohls have relied too much on coupons to get customers through their doors That formula doesnt work for millennial and Gen Z shoppers he said They want compelling merchandise and clear pricing — things theyre finding at offprice stores like TJ Maxx instead Led by Kingsbury Kohls is trying to capitalize on life stages that tend to spark purchases such as decorating an apartment for the first time or having a baby The retailer plans to add Babies R Us shops to about  of its stores in the fall It is now carrying more home goods such as lighting and wall art Kohls has also used Sephora shops which it is expanding to all stores to draw in younger shoppers and try to nudge them to other parts of the store When they come in for Sephora we want to make sure we can give them product they want as well Kingsbury said Still Kohls doesnt expect to see immediate results from the moves It said in March that it anticipates net sales to range from a  decrease to a  increase for the full year and comparable sales to range from flat to  higher Macys is opening more smallformat stores across the country They are roughly one fifth the size of its typical locations Macys With a new CEO at the top Macys wants to refresh its namesake brand and shutter stores that have dragged down the companys sales It plans to close more than a quarter of its approximately  namesake stores by early  At the same time Macys is trying to go where younger shoppers are including suburban strip malls and beauty aisles The company plans to open up to  of its smaller offmall Macys stores over the next two years The locations are roughly onefifth the size of its traditional mall stores and typically next to grocers bigbox stores and offprice retailers which have steadier foot traffic Its also opening more Bloomingdales stores and more locations of Bluemercury its beauty chain — and taking steps to woo younger customers in the process Macys CEO Tony Spring who stepped into the role in February previously led Bloomingdales which carries luxury brands but also has popular private labels like clothing brand Aqua Its also known for unique customer experiences such as limitedtime events or collections that tap into pop culture moments like the Barbie movie Hes hinted more of that is coming to Macys The company has debuted new exclusive clothing brands and given others a makeover Its trying to make Macys more of an attraction including by having a play area in Toys R Us shops within the stores or cocktails inside of Bloomies its smaller offmall version of Bloomingdales Despite efforts to jolt sales the companys forecast is muted Macys expects fullyear net sales to range between  billion and  billion down from  billion in the prior year It expects comparable sales which take out the impact of store openings and closures to range from a decline of about  to a gain of  compared with the yearago period on an ownedpluslicensed basis and including thirdparty marketplace sales

Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank a weekly guide to the highnetworth investor and consumer Sign up to receive future editions straight to your inbox The rich have taken quiet wealth to a new level turning to private purchases of mansions art and classic cars designed to avoid attention according to experts Auction companies and luxury real estate brokers say wealthy buyers and sellers are increasingly turning to private sales and offmarket listings to avoid social media and prying eyes While public auction sales are declining in the art world private sales — done behind closed doors between discreet buyers and sellers — are growing Last year while combined public auction sales for Sothebys Christies and Phillips fell by  private sales increased by  at Sothebys and  at Christies totaling  billion across the two auction houses CNBC reported in February that Christies had sold a Mark Rothko painting for over  million to hedgefund billionaire Ken Griffin even as public auctions continued to decline Classic cars are also seeing a shift to private sales especially with the most expensive and rare models RM Sothebys the classiccar auction company has sold trophy Ferraris Porsches and other trophy cars by public auction for more than  years But its newly formed RM Sothebys private sales division has seen its sales more than quadruple over the past four years according to Shelby Myers global head of private sales for RM Sothebys Private sales where cars are discreetly brokered between buyer and seller without an auction or public price now account for nearly a third of revenue he said Weve definitely seen a trend where people want to transact privately Myers said Discretion today is key People can buy without the whole world staring at them The rise in private sales for classic cars art real estate and other markets is being driven by social media technology and cooling prices for collectibles When a work of art or classic car comes up for auction the results and sometimes the seller are highly public spread over social media and blogs Collectibles experts say sellers dont want to risk putting a treasured item up for auction only to have it stumble publicly on the auction block Its very public now when someone loses money on a sale and no one wants that Myers said Up until a few years ago you could buy a car at auction and the prices wouldnt be splattered all over social media Collectors who like to show their cars at events and award shows are also shying away from auctions since viewers are more likely to be able to figure out how much the owner paid The car enthusiasts used to be a relatively small tightknit group Myers said Now when a major collector shows their car it spreads like wildfire over blogs and the internet And everyone can see who the owner is and what they paid In real estate many of the biggest deals in Manhattan Malibu Aspen the Hamptons and Palm Beach are now in private or offmarket sales Also known as whisper or pocket listings offmarket properties are not listed on multiple listing services or public websites but are shopped around quietly among a select group of brokers and buyers A townhouse in Manhattans Greenwich Village sold this year in an offmarket deal for  million making it the most expensive townhouse ever sold downtown A squarefoot mansion in Palm Beach sold offmarket for  million making it one the most expensive nonwaterfront homes ever sold on the island And Aspens first sale of over  million — Patrick Dovigis mansion on Red Mountain to billionaires Steve Wynn and Thomas Peterffy — was offmarket with the broker representing both the buyer and seller Los Angeles is considered the birthplace of offmarket deals starting in the s and s when celebrities and movie stars wanted to avoid overzealous fans visiting their listed homes Over time according to Douglas Elliman real estate agent Ernie Carswell in Los Angeles wealthy not but famous sellers have joined in on the offmarket craze Even the average multimillionaire or billionaire likes the idea of selling without the media and privacy invasion Carswell said Carswell said he currently has a billionaire client in New York who wants a special property in Los Angeles so Carswell is looking at a megamansion owned by a Middle Eastern billionaire who is offering it only to select buyers Hes also working on a deal in Palm Springs with a celebrity selling a home he didnt want to be publicly shown to a billionaire buyer who doesnt want any photos of his new home on the web They dont want burglars to know how to get to the bedroom or how much land there is or how to get through the hedges Carswell said I blame technology Carswell said offmarket listings dont make sense for properties under  million since they have a larger possible buying pool and benefit from broader marketing But for special megahomes in Malibu Bel Air or Beverly Hills priced over  million the list of potential buyers is smaller and most are already known to the brokers which makes an offmarket agreement more appealing That makes broker relationships even more important — especially to the wealthy Carswell said Never before has the need for a skilled connected real estate professional been more valuable especially at the high end he said Still some brokers say even for pricey properties sellers who go private dont get the highest price since theyre limiting their pool of potential buyers Theyre leaving money on the table said real estate broker Noble Black of Douglas Elliman There is a valid reason for not listing you want privacy and discretion But youre paying a premium for that Sign up to receive future editions of CNBCs Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank

CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Wayfair store in Wilmette Illinois Courtesy Wayfair What retail apocalypse Online home goods retailer Wayfair is opening its first namesake store near Chicago following a string of other digitally native companies that have turned to brickandmortar for growth In an ironic twist for a company that became a  billion powerhouse by persuading consumers to buy couches and beds online Wayfair is leaning into the most basic building blocks of retail Thats because no matter how far tech has evolved shoppers still cant try out a new mattress from their laptops or phones If you think about the categories were in theyre typically very visual categories or very tactile or you know considered purchases because its reasonably expensive and youre going to put a lot of care into picking the right item Wayfair CEO and cofounder Niraj Shah told CNBC Depending on what purchase someones making they may prefer the instore experience and getting to work with an associate he said Or they may want to discuss financing or want design help and we can provide all of those experiences We provide them online as well but sometimes instore can be either more pleasurable or more effective The

retail ambitions come as onlineonly companies look to plot their next phases of growth in a landscape that has evolved since their companies were founded making it harder than ever to run a profitable ecommerce business Privacy changes on Meta and Apple iOS have made it more difficult for marketers to target customers in advertising campaigns Companies also face more competition from Chineselinked upstarts such as Shein and Temu Returns and the scams that come along with them are a neverending moneylosing game With the proliferation of online marketplaces on Amazon  Walmart and Target  just about anyone can be a retailer — and brands can find themselves competing against their own manufacturers Many companies that started by selling directly to consumers now offer their wares in department stores and bigbox retailers but even that brings pitfalls Brands that earned their competitive edge by gathering enormous amounts of data on their customers dont have as much visibility when theyre working with wholesalers nor do they make as much money Theyre also subject to the whims of their partners and could be taken off the shelves with little notice or risk losing a primary revenue source if that wholesaler suddenly goes under or sees sales fall When brands have their own stores in addition to websites they have a lot more control over mitigating those risks Plus torrid ecommerce growth during the Covid pandemic has moderated and fallen to below its prepandemic low US Census data shows Given the seemingly inextricable role online shopping plays in most Americans lives some may be surprised to learn that the vast majority of retail sales — about  in  — still happen offline according to Census data For some of my companies in our various experiences stores can

Brickandmortar is back Wayfairs physical store ambitions reflect a bigger wave of brickandmortar openings In the early s new store openings largely outpaced closures until the tide turned in  Nearly  retail storefronts were shuttered and only about  new ones opened that year according to Coresight Researchs US and UK Store Tracker Databank The spike in store closures sparked headlines about the socalled retail apocalypse and warnings that stores would die off as shopping moved online For a while that seemed to be true New store closures outpaced openings until the trend changed in  For the first time in five years more storefronts opened than closed resulting in  net new openings There were  net new openings in  and there have already been  net new openings in  as of May  Discount

all be doing it But retail fundamentals can bring a steep learning curve for companies that started out as online disruptors Expanding into physical retail is challenging and expensive Companies looking to open stores need to figure out a physical location along with furnishings and supplies and the logistics such as transporting inventory said Amish Tolia the cofounder and CEO of Leap a

since 2016, and now owns about 6% of the iPhone maker.",search.cnbc.com,In this article AAPL BRKA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Tim Cook and Warren Buffett Getty Images L  CNBC R Berkshire Hathaway s Warren Buffett was still using a flip phone as late as  four years after his investment behemoth started amassing a huge stake in the company that makes iPhones I dont understand the phone at all but I do understand consumer behavior Buffett said last year at Berkshires annual shareholder meeting in Omaha Nebraska Hes emerged in recent years as one of Apples top evangelists At the end of  Berkshire owned about  of Apple a stake worth  billion at the time or about  of the conglomerates total value Thats about four times bigger than Berkshires secondbiggest public stock holding Bank of America  and makes the company the No  Apple shareholder behind only Vanguard As Berkshire investors and fanboys of the yearold Buffett flood Omaha this weekend for the  annual meeting Apple is likely to be a hot topic of discussion The tech giant on Thursday reported a  yearoveryear decline in iPhone sales leading to a  drop in total revenue But the stock had its best day since late  on Friday due largely to a  billion stock buyback plan and increased margins that result from a growing services business The bet on Apple and CEO Tim Cook has paid off handsomely for Buffett who said in  that the cost of Berkshires Apple stake was only  billion His firm is up almost  on its investment since the start of  Despite being a selfdescribed Luddite Buffett has long had a coherent nontechie thesis for loving Apple Hes seen how devoted Apple users are to their devices and has viewed the iPhone as an extraordinary product that could keep its customers spending inside the Apple ecosystem He calls it a moat one of his favorite words for describing his preferred businesses Apple has a position with consumers that theyre paying  or whatever it may be for a phone and these same people pay  for a second car Buffett said at last years meeting And if they had to give up their second car or give up their iPhone theyd give up their second car watch now Data is in his favor According to a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners Apple benefits from  customer loyalty meaning that nine out of  current US iPhone owners choose another iPhone when buying a new device Buffett also has hailed Apples ability to return billions of dollars to shareholders annually through share buybacks and dividends a capital allocation strategy for which the billionaire investor may have himself to thank When the Apple CEO was asked in a  interview with The Washington Post who he turns to for advice at pivotal moments Cook offered up a story about his relationship with Buffett When I was going through the question of what should we do on returning cash to shareholders I thought who could really give us great advice here Who wouldnt have a bias Cook said So I called up Warren Buffett I thought hes the natural person Apple has shown its appreciation for the Oracle of Omaha in other ways In  the company published an original iPhone game called Warren Buffetts Paper Wizard in which a paperboy bikes from Omaha to Apples hometown of Cupertino California But with Apples business having declined in size in five of the past six quarters and with the company expecting just low singledigit growth in the current quarter Buffett may face questions this weekend at the shareholder meeting about whether he still sees the same power in the moat particularly with regulatory pressures building around techs megacap companies Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple late last year though only by about  Even after Fridays rally the stock is down  in  while the SP  is up  Very very very locked in Berkshires initial foray into Apple in  was not Buffetts idea Rather the investment was led by Ted Weschler one of his top deputies and was seen as a passing of the torch to the next generation of Berkshire investment managers But the following year Berkshire started purchasing even more Apple shares and Buffett began talking it up He said he liked the stock and the companys sticky product although he didnt use it In  he said Apple users are very very very locked in at least psychologically and mentally to the product and the ecosystem Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise he said At last years annual meeting when asked how Berkshire can defend having Apple make up so much of its public portfolio Buffett said It just happens to be a better business than any we own He also hailed Cook calling him one of the best managers in the world A number Apple likes to use to tout the health of its business despite the declining revenue is  billion Thats how many devices the company says are currently in use and points to the massive customer base available as Apple rolls out new subscription services Once customers get into the ecosystem they dont leave So its not a speculative tech play said Dan Eye chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group which owns Apple shares Its kind of more like an annuity and I think thats what Warren Buffett really sees as well In addition to the drop in revenue Apple faces new challenges from regulations and weak overseas markets as well as from Microsoft and Googles advancements in artificial intelligence For regulators the concern surrounds the very moat that Buffett finds so attractive and whether it gives the company monopolistic control in the smartphone market The US government in March alleged that Apple designs its business to keep customers locked in The Department of Justices lawsuit claimed that products like Apple Card the Apple Arcade game subscription iMessage and Apple Watch work best or only with an iPhone creating illegal barriers to competition and making it harder for consumers to switch when its time for an upgrade However the litigation is expected to take years pushing any potential penalties to Apple and its products well into the future In the meantime theres no sign that the iPhone is becoming less important as new devices like virtual reality goggles have found only niche audiences while consumer AI products have failed to take off watch now Buffett hasnt voiced his view publicly on Apples regulatory hurdles and this will be the first opportunity for investors to ask him about the issue since the DOJs lawsuit But Buffett knows a little something about regulation — two markets where hes most active are railroads and insurance In a note to clients earlier this month Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi didnt go deep on regulatory concerns but mentioned that he doesnt believe the DOJ suit will seriously threaten the strength of Apples ecosystem He also said that following Buffetts lead on getting in and out of Apple is a solid strategy for making money Despite his reputation as a long term buy and hold investor Warren Buffett has been remarkably disciplined at adding to his Apple position when it is relatively cheap and trimming when it is relatively expensive Sacconaghi wrote He encouraged investors to be like Buffett More money back Odds are that Buffett was thrilled with Apples announcement this week regarding its expanded repurchase program Its a practice hes long adored When I buy Apple I know that Apple is going to repurchase a lot of shares he said in  And he likes to note how buybacks result in getting a bigger stake in the company without buying more shares The math of repurchases grinds away slowly but can be powerful over time Buffett said in  Apple also increased its dividend by  and signaled that it would continue to lift it annually Buffett was effusive about the tech giants capitalreturn strategy at the conglomerates annual meeting last year pointing out that it helped Berkshire own a bigger piece of the pie Unlike insurance company Geico and homebuilder Clayton Homes which his firm owns in their entirety Berkshire can continue to increase its stake in Apple a fact he reminded investors of at the meeting The good thing about Apple is that we can go up Buffett said

investor Warren Buffett has been making a confidential wager on the financial industry since the third quarter of last year The identity of the stock — or stocks — that Berkshire has been snapping up could be revealed Saturday at the companys annual shareholder meeting in Omaha Nebraska Thats because unless Berkshire has been granted confidential treatment on the investment for a third quarter in a row the stake will be disclosed in filings later this month So the yearold Berkshire CEO may decide to explain his rationale to the thousands of investors flocking to the gathering The bet shrouded in mystery has captivated Berkshire investors since it first appeared in disclosures late last year At a time when Buffett has been a net seller of stocks and lamented a dearth of opportunities capable of truly moving the needle at Berkshire he has apparently found something he likes — and in the financial realm no less Thats an area he has dialed back on in recent years over concerns about rising loan defaults High interest rates have taken a toll on some financial players like regional US banks while making the yield on Berkshires cash pile in instruments like Tbills suddenly attractive When you are the GOAT of investing people are interested in what you think is good said Glenview Trust Co Chief Investment Officer Bill Stone using an acronym for greatest of all time What

investment disclosures give no clue as to what the stock could be Stone Kass and other Buffett watchers believe it is a multibilliondollar wager on a financial name Thats because the cost basis of banks insurers and finance stocks owned by the company jumped by  billion in the second half of last year the only category to increase according to separate Berkshire filings At the same time Berkshire exited financial names by dumping insurers Markel and Globe Life  leading investors to estimate that the wager could be as large as  billion or  billion through the end of  Its unknown

where retail investors were trading out of cash into higheryielding investments Shanahan said Nobody wanted to own that name last year so Buffett couldve bought as much as he wanted Other names that

Berkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlies inspiration wisdom and participation Buffett said in a statement In addition to being Berkshire vice chairman Munger was a real estate attorney chairman and publisher of the Daily Journal Corp a member of the Costco board a philanthropist and an architect In early  his fortune was estimated at  billion — a jawdropping amount for many people but vastly smaller than Buffetts unfathomable fortune which is estimated at more than  billion During Berkshires  annual shareholder meeting the thenyearold Munger

complications from cataract surgery in  Munger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from  to  when Buffetts Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena Californiabased insurance and investment company it did not own Buffett credited Munger with broadening his investment strategy from favoring troubled companies at low prices in hopes of getting a profit to focusing on higherquality but underpriced companies An early example of the shift was illustrated in  by Mungers ability to persuade Buffett to sign off on Berkshires purchase of Sees Candies for  million even though the California candy maker had annual pretax earnings of only about  million It has since produced more than  billion in sales for Berkshire He weaned me away from the idea of buying very soso

we like better than AutoZone AutoZone NYSE AZO share prices are declining because the Q results weren’t strong enough The company says the timing of tax payments and cold weather impacted the results which are oneoff nonrecurring factors that have little to do with the outlook The outlook for AutoZone is the same as it has been steady growth and solid cash flow share repurchases and an uptrending

Trading Selling Shares Projected Earnings Growth  See Full Details AutoZone doesn’t pay a dividend but is an aggressive share repurchaser who bought back  million in Q Repurchases in F are within the company’s free cash flow allowing for business growth while maintaining a healthy balance sheet The balance sheet highlights include a flat cash position low leverage and an increasing deficit As with Lowe’s Companies NYSE LOW the increasing deficit isn’t a red flag but the result of massive share buybacks and share retirement The company spends lots of money on what is effectively nothing shares that no longer exist the benefit for shareholders is that the companys value continues to rise and there are fewer shares providing leverage for capital gain Analysts Support the Uptrend in AutoZone The analysts were slow to issue revisions following the release suggesting there is little to change in the outlook As it is the eighteen analysts tracked by Marketbeatcom have this stock pegged at Moderate Buy The Moderate Buy rating has been steady for at least twelve months and comes with an upwardly trending price target The price target implies about  upside from the current price action enough to put the market back at its alltime high A move to new highs is possible but may not come until later in the year after Q results are released The market is moving lower and may continue to fall However institutional support is solid for this stock and will likely step in to support the price when it reaches critical levels The best target for solid support is near  and an uptrend line in place since  If that level fails to hold the market the stock price could fall to  or lower before finding solid support In that scenario the uptrend would still be intact but the market may enter a consolidation that keeps it range bound for the next few quarters or longer A rebound should form soon after if the market confirms support at the uptrend line Before you consider AutoZone youll

strategies, types of investments, and tips for maximizing your returns.",www.marketbeat.com,When tracking the US stock market you’ll usually see quotes from  major indices the Dow Jones Industrial Average the SP  and the NASDAQ Composite Index All  are proxies for US stock market performance but they don’t always share the same components and weigh their stocks differently The NASDAQ is the newest of the major indices composed of the techheavy companies trading on the NASDAQ exchange Confused yet Read on to learn more about the difference between the NASDAQ exchange and the NASDAQ Composite Index and how to invest in its component securities The NASDAQ exchange was one of the first marketplaces to eschew a trading floor in favor of a fully electronic system Traders could buy and sell stocks through a digital network which increased speed and reduced bidask spreads Today all exchanges operate using computers and traders can move stocks with a few smartphone taps However the NASDAQ is still an essential cog in global markets and investors should be aware of the different securities based on it Get analyst upgrade alerts Sign Up What Is Nasdaq NASDAQ is an acronym for National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotes named after the organization that designed it The NASDAQ exchange is the global electronic marketplace launched in  but the NASDAQ Composite Index is a market capweighted index composed of the companies trading on the exchange NASDAQ is known for its tech concentration but there are over  stocks on the exchange in sectors ranging from finance to consumer staples to healthcare For inclusion in the NASDAQ Composite Index a security must meet the following requirements Ad Paradigm Press Former CIA advisor Dark side of AI now starting A former CIA Advisor is now predicting The dark side of AI is here See exactly what he means here now Exclusively listed on the NASDAQ exchange Note that if a company was listed on another exchange before  it could be included in the Composoite as long as it maintains its previous exchange listing Must be a common stock ordinary share American Depository Receipt ADR Share of Beneficial Interest Real Estate Investment Trust REIT or limited partnership to be considered for inclusion ETFs ETNs or preferred stock cannot be included Ways to Invest in Nasdaq Buying all  stocks in the NASDAQ Composite would stretch your portfolio thin Thankfully investors and fund companies have been getting NASDAQ exposure through more conventional means since the Dot Com Boom Here are  easy paths to invest in NASDAQ Direct Stock Purchases One method of NASDAQ investing is to concentrate your portfolio into a smaller assortment of stocks through direct purchases Investing in individual stocks is the riskiest and most timeconsuming way of gaining NASDAQ exposure but some investors prefer it for the potential indexbeating returns Always conduct due diligence on your target stocks and ensure they align with your goals and timeframe Nasdaqfocused ETFs If picking individual stocks isn’t ideal consider an ETF  a basket of stocks based on a particular theme or strategy One of the most popular ETFs is Invesco QQQ NASDAQ QQQ the  billion capweighted colossus composed of the top  nonfinance firms in the Composite When choosing an ETF consider the fund’s goals methodology and costs before investing Some QQQ alternatives include the broader Fidelity NASDAQ Composite ETF NASDAQ ONEQ and the balanced Direxion NASDAQ Equal Weighted Index NASDAQ QQQE Mutual Funds Like ETFs mutual funds are baskets of stocks bundled into a single security However ETFs trade on exchanges during open market hours mutual funds aren’t actively traded and shares can only be swapped after net asset value NAV is calculated at day’s end Mutual funds are less taxefficient than ETFs and frequently carry higher expense rates but they’re the primary investment vehicle for k savers since ETFs aren’t allowed and taxes on capital gains distributions can be deferred How to Choose the Right Investment Strategy Picking an investment strategy requires a little selfanalysis What are your goals as an investor How much risk do you want to take You can’t control market returns so focus on what’s within your grasp Consider the following factors Time Horizon  How long do you plan on staying invested If you have a long timeline you can likely handle a riskier portfolio since you can dollarcost average your way through a bear market However with shortterm goals a steep decline is tougher to tolerate Investment Goals  What’s the objective behind your investments If you’re saving for retirement consider taxdeferred accounts like a k or Roth IRA But if you’re in a standard account you won’t get tax advantages and will probably consider a different asset allocation Financial Situation  No one gives away stocks for free and you need to consider how much you can afford to invest before buying any assets If you max out your retirement vehicles and still have leftover income to invest your plan might differ from someone who can only fill  of a k account Investment decisions are always personal so consult with an advisor if you want to get serious about building a portfolio A Guide for Getting Started If you decide that exposure to NASDAQ stocks suits your investment goals you must open a brokerage account to construct a portfolio Don’t know where to get started Follow these  simple steps  Research and Select a Brokerage Firm Now that commissions on stock and ETF investments are nonexistent at most brokers investors have more factors to consider when picking a broker You’ll still need to research each broker’s fee schedule for transfer fees inactivity fees and margin rates But also consider features like charting tools technical indicators and research especially if you’re actively trading individual stocks If you’re choosing between a few favorites look for a demo or paper trading account to test the platform before depositing any real cash  Open a Trading Account Once you’ve picked a broker you must open an account Your investment goals will dictate which account you open Are you saving for retirement Consider a traditional or Roth IRA for tax benefits If you aren’t opening a taxdeferred account you’ll need to choose between cash or margin Margin accounts allow investors to borrow capital but rates apply and margin accounts are subject to pattern day trader PDT rules Regardless of your account you’ll need to fill out a few forms to register and provide documentation like a drivers license social security or proof of residence  Invest in Individual Stocks or Funds If you have a portfolio strategy in mind for your NASDAQ investments you can locate your preferred assets through your broker and purchase shares If you don’t have a plan yet use MarketBeat’s tools to narrow your stock selection and learn how to place orders  Keep Up with Financial News Even the best investment strategy requires occasional tweaking so stay current with market headlines and economic news If market sentiment changes you may need to adjust your asset allocation sooner than initially anticipated Risks and Rewards of Investing in Nasdaq Investing in NASDAQ especially in securities like QQQ has provided investors with breathtaking highs and stomachchurning lows Look no further than the Dot Com Bubble to see how highly volatile tech stocks can run up past reasonable valuations only to crash and burn devastatingly The NASDAQ Composite Index contains a wide range of stocks including many small caps that lack favorable fundamentals Additionally the heaviestweighted companies are tech giants like NVIDIA Corp NASDAQ NVDA and Amazon Inc NASDAQ AMZN which are known to be volatile despite their size and maturity Learning how to invest in NASDAQ requires a certain level of risk tolerance but the gains over the last decadeplus have been worth it for investors Thanks to largecap tech the NASDAQ  index has vastly outperformed the SP  since the end of the Global Financial Crisis although with deeper corrections and volatility along the way Regardless of your investment strategy always mitigate risk through diversification have a longterm plan and be flexible if the market data changes Conclusion The NASDAQ Composite is more volatile than its peers thanks to the tech concentration but tech has been one of the most rewarding sectors in the postGFC era While a portfolio of only tech stocks might be too risky for the average investor NASDAQ investments

Nasdaq vs. S&P: A Detailed Breakdown of Stock Indexes,https://www.marketbeat.com/learn/nasdaq-vs-s-and-p-a-detailed-breakdown-of-stock-indexes/,"Mon, 20 May 2024 10:01:00 GMT","This article introduces readers to the major differences between the S&amp;P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index, as well as how they're similar.",www.marketbeat.com,The Nasdaq and the SP  are both major measures used to track the health of specific segments of the economy The Nasdaq is a global electronic marketplace for buying and selling securities best known for its higher concentration of tech stocks Its index the Nasdaq Composite is used as a benchmark to compare the performance of technology and biotech stocks The SP  is a competing index that includes a wide range of sectors but limits inclusions to the largest US stocks While both indexes serve similar functions the best investment for your portfolio may vary depending on your risk tolerance and investing timeline Get stock market alerts Sign Up What Are Stock Indexes Both the Nasdaq and the SP  are market indexes important tools used to track the performance of a group of assets Stock market indexes consider only a select “basket” of stocks providing investors with a quick glimpse into how that group of assets is performing over time and on any particular day Stock indexes are crucial tools for comparing investments against one another serving as a benchmark that tracks the average movement within an industry or group of stocks For example imagine that you’re a tech investor and you want to know if returns on recent stock investment are beating what you’d see if you’d invested the same capital into the general tech market By comparing your rate of return to the average return of a techfocused index like the Dow Jones US Technology Index you can quickly see if your investments are beating the general movement of the market Market Composition The first and most pronounced difference between the SP  and the Nasdaq are the types of stocks that make up the “basket” mentioned above The Nasdaq focuses primarily on technologydriven companies with the Nasdaq Composite Index including more than  individual stocks that qualify for inclusion on the Nasdaq exchange The Nasdaq includes both internationally and domestically based companies The SP  index is largely considered to be a general measure of the performance of the US economy as a whole The “” in the name refers to the number of stocks included in the index which is composed of the top  largest companies in the United States Unlike the Nasdaq the SP  features stocks in sectors like technology healthcare finance and consumer goods Inclusion Criteria There are a few variations in the stocks included in both indexes The Nasdaq is made up of all stocks operating on the market which is primarily techbased If a company meets the qualification criteria for listing on the Nasdaq exchange it qualifies for inclusion in the Composite index The SP  is more strict in its inclusion criteria While it includes companies from a wide range of sectors the index is only representative of the top  domestic companies when measured by market capitalization It includes stocks from both the Nasdaq exchange and the New York Stock Exchange but does not consider international companies like the Nasdaq Composite does Market Cap Variation The Nasdaq Composite is made up primarily of tech companies which tend to feature higher market capitalizations on average than companies in other sectors Many of the top stocks included on the Nasdaq like Apple and Microsoft are also major components of the SP  While the SP  categorizes inclusions and weighting by market capitalization it features largecap mediumcap and a few smallcap stocks What Are the Similarities Between Nasdaq and the SP  Both the Nasdaq and the SP  are major stock market indexes used to track and measure the performance of a basket of representative stocks While the criteria for inclusion might vary between them both are used as benchmarks to compare the performance of a smaller or individual asset to the returns of some segment of the overall market Stock market indexes are also notable for their association with exchangetraded funds ETFs ETFs are investment funds that trade on the stock market in the same way as individual shares of stock Most of the world’s largest ETFs track some form of stock index For example the Vanguard SP  ETF NYSE VOO is an ETF that includes assets in accordance with the composition of the SP  The goal of these funds is to replicate the performance of the index and both the Nasdaq and SP  are the basis for multiple ETFs Is It Better to Invest in the Nasdaq Composite or the SP  The Nasdaq and the SP  serve different purposes to investment analysts and investors alike The best investment choice for your needs will vary depending on how long you plan to stay in the market and your overall portfolio makeup with the SP  usually being considered the more conservative choice Risk Tolerance Between the Nasdaq and the SP  the Nasdaq is usually considered the less stable option The index is driven primarily by tech stocks which tend to be classified as growth stocks Growth stocks are companies that reinvest most of their profits back into growth and new asset development which give them the potential to grow longterm While these stocks usually show higher potential for return they’re also more volatile than larger more established companies — like those that make up the SP  If you’re looking for a less volatile investment option or have a lower risk tolerance you may want to opt for the SP  Time Horizon If you’re investing on a longer time frame you may want to consider investing more heavily in the Nasdaq The Nasdaq is made up of a high number of growth stocks which tend to be more volatile in the shortterm when compared to bluechip options If you’re investing for a more conservative goal like a retirement that’s coming in a few years you may want to invest more heavily in the SP  Diversification Needs Diversification is the idea that you should invest in multiple sectors companies and types of assets to reduce your financial risk in the longterm The SP  features more intrinsic diversification than the Nasdaq which primarily focuses on technology and biotech stocks If you’re looking to add more diversification to your portfolio you may want to learn towards the SP  It’s important to remember that you don’t necessarily need to choose one or the other when investing in an index You may want to include investments in both the SP  index and the Nasdaq Composite when creating your portfolio Make Your Investment Decisions with Confidence The Nasdaq and SP  are both stock market indexes used to track specific segments of the market While the Nasdaq focuses primarily on the top technology leaders the SP  focuses on summarizing the performance of the largest companies in the United States The best market index to invest in will vary based on your risk tolerance with the SP  usually considered to be the more stable choice for longterm investors

outperform others even if there are currently hot issues in the technology sector While some may keep their focus  and capital  in names like Nvidia Co NASDAQ NVDA or choose to follow the meme stock

this quarter The Economy is Just Right According to this  macro outlook report set by the Goldman Sachs Group Inc analysts the US manufacturing sector could be set for a breakout this year here’s why Because the Federal Reserve the Fed proposes cutting interest rates later this year which could be as soon as September  according to the CME’s FedWatch tool the dollar index could decline in value as most currencies are valued based on their interest rates A potentially lower dollar could make American exports more attractive for foreign buyers a theme that was present in February’s ISM

"Burry Just Sold Amazon, Replaced it With Alibaba, is He Right?",https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/burry-just-sold-amazon-replaced-it-with-alibaba-is-he-right/,"Mon, 20 May 2024 07:26:00 GMT",Those looking to improve their risk/reward ratios within their portfolios can follow Michael Burry's lead out of Amazon and into Alibaba,www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Michael Burry joined Ray Dalio in his hunt for higher rewards tied to lower risks which he found in Chinese stocks Selling out of Americas technology sector Burry plunged into Alibaba and JDcom stock recently Analysts agree that Alibabas discount and upside are similar to Amazons giving a better riskreward ratio  stocks we like better than Alibaba Group Far from blindly following the most prominent names on Wall Street retail investors could reverse engineer the recent moves made by giants like Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio However a critical piece of information must be added to this equation Relative account size and buying power Running the largest hedge fund in the world Dalio can’t just pick any value stock it has to be a big enough fish to reel in In the same way Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc NYSE BRKA can’t just go with any value stock as the company’s financials now hold a record  billion in cash set aside for the right opportunity So for investors in their early days an investor like Michael Burry the guy who called the  financial crisis is better suited to reverse engineer investment decisions Get Alibaba Group alerts Sign Up Burry’s fund Scion Capital shows exciting decisions in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors in both the US and China He has reduced his positioning in Amazoncom Inc NASDAQ AMZN while buying up shares of Alibaba Group NYSE BABA and taking an interest in physical gold funds Here’s what could be driving Burry to make this rotation today A Global Market Super Cycle Alibaba Group Today BABA Alibaba Group    Week Range    Dividend Yield  PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist The two most important economies in the world are about to make a rotation which has yet to be seen since  Chinese and American stocks should be at the top of investors minds worldwide though not all are created equal Amazon is part of the ‘magnificent ’ which recently pushed the SP and NASDAQ indexes to new alltime highs However the rest of the market showed lackluster performance meaning that a small percentage of companies were responsible for most of the stock market’s run Those getting most of the credit were found in the technology and business services sectors According to the ISM services PMI index these sectors have had consecutive monthly expansions since  which recently took a turn to the downside April’s services PMI showed the first contraction reading in more than  months while its cousin the ISM manufacturing PMI edged closer to expanding after a month contraction In China it’s been more challenging to say the least The Chinese economys manufacturing and services sectors have been in contraction since the COVID pandemic which is why the CSI  Chinas SP  fell to neardecade lows Stocks became so cheap that their average dividend yield surpassed the Chinese year bonds Any time this happens in an economy investors consider equities in that nation to be cheap enough to pose little to no risk The last time this happened in the US was in  when a  rally came soon after in only a year Knowing that this rotation out of American services and technology like Amazon and into anything Chinese is about to happen Burry decided to take this rotation literally Here’s What Investors Can Do with This Information Recently stocks in the manufacturing sector have outperformed most in the magnificent seven to crystalize this economic fact Shares of Mueller Water Products Inc NYSE MWA and ATI Inc NYSE ATI have outperformed names like Nvidia Co NASDAQ NVDA Tesla Inc NASDAQ TSLA and even Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL over the past month Seeing the markets play out the rotation in live price action investors can start hunting for value in both US manufacturing sectors or look to take on a bit more risk for potentially more reward in Chinese names like Alibaba Pegging these two technology giants against each other here’s what that looks like Is Burry Right in This Decision For starters being a value

looking to lead the comeback from Chinese stocks, calling enough attention from Ray Dalio and even Michael Burry making JD his biggest holding today.",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points JDs business is

through the media’s fine print could end up owning some of the most exciting and fastgrowing stocks in the market today The news follows stock prices so when the CSI  China’s SP  reached nearly a

discretionary sector of any economy it’s all about inflation usually After seeing flat to negative inflation in the third and fourth quarters of  the Chinese consumer seemed asleep causing most of the concern investors felt around Chinese stocks However after pumping out three consecutive months of positive inflation the Chinese economy looks like it may be on its way back to health Behind this trend is the government itself as Chinese officials have been sending round after round of economic stimuli to help rescue the stock market What started with restrictions on short selling has now ended up in a  billion bond sale from China along with  direct injections into the economy in part of the government All of this added liquidity has to end up somewhere and JD’s business is one of them According to the company’s press release net product revenues jumped by  over the past  months far from being a symptom of a deadbeat economy Following suit net services revenue also increased by  during the period giving investors critical information regarding the Chinese economy Because both products and services are rising investors can tie JD’s results to the Caixin Composite PMI index expansion since November  The research behind Burry’s and Dalio’s buying could be about to pay off How’s The Market Feeling Now A  rally in the past quarter is a great place to start answering this question now that JD stock trades at  of its week high investors can safely begin to assume that bullish momentum is taking over the stock Once upon a time stocks like JD were deemed ‘uninvestable’ a

considered valid today More than that these analysts expect to see  earnings per share EPS growth ahead for this year far from Chinas widespread bearish economic expectation The changing current should be an initial green flag for investors to investigate Chinese stocks further Despite recent outperformance JD stock trades at a discount to the retail sector measured in pricetoearnings PE

showing investors its proper fundamentals are still solid today Expected to grow its EPS above peers and beat inflation analysts see a doubledigit upside in price targets Under Armour stock trades at a discount to the sector despite a better positioning  stocks we like better than Alibaba Group After shares of Under Armour Inc NYSE UA plummeted by  in the premarket session of Thursday morning due to the company’s release of its first quarter  earnings results bearish traders may have reversed their initial decision The stock ranged within a couple of percentage points during the day closing lower by  to finish the day The initial reaction was aided by a bearish predisposition surrounding the consumer discretionary sector with a particular cautionary note attached to retail apparel names like Under Armour However things may not be as bad as they seem as investors soon find out that US consumers may receive a bailout shortly through interest rate cuts Get Alibaba Group alerts Sign Up Focusing on what matters Wall Street analysts give Main Street enough evidence to potentially consider Under Armour as a top candidate in the sector even when pegged against leaders like Nike Inc NYSE NKE and Lululemon Athletica Inc NASDAQ LULU Before investors get into the weeds of the deal here’s why the economy is just right for these stocks The Right Mix for Portfolios Under Armour Today UA Under Armour    Week Range    PE Ratio  Add to Watchlist Economists had to wake up to their worst nightmare this quarter as the US economy grew only  in gross domestic product GDP while inflation rates remained above  This is known as stagflation where there’s little to no economic growth with high inflation Stagflation is tricky since the Federal Reserve the Fed can’t solve the economic growth issue by simply lowering rates Inflation is persistent and would only get worse in a lowerrate environment On the other hand keeping high rates would only worsen already weak economic growth with the hopes of keeping inflation tamed as a tradeoff The good news is investors don’t need to be economists to figure out what to do with their portfolios The mix is pretty simple find companies set to grow beyond lackluster GDP projections while keeping up with  and ideally beating  inflation Why Under Armour Has the Right Fit Targeting these characteristics investors can find a home for their investment dollars in Under Armour stock particularly when considering Wall Street analyst projections Behemoths like Nike and Lululemon can’t  and aren’t expected to  push for high earnings per share EPS growth rates like Under Armour can Being a  billion company has its perks and  EPS growth projections for this year is one of them Under Armour’s EPS growth stand above Nike’s  projections leading ahead of Lululemon’s  Despite being set to grow above its peers Under Armour stock is still trading at a  discount to the consumer discretionary sector measured on a PE basis A x PE multiple gives investors aboveaverage EPS growth at belowaverage valuations Nike’s x PE barely commands a premium as its EPS is barely escaping the eroding effects of inflation today Not much else is to be said about Lululemon’s x PE other than that it is still a much more expensive deal than Under Armour Management is Well Aware of Discounts When companies decide to buy back their own stock it is typically driven by two factors First the stock is considered to be cheap by insiders standards and second the stock is expected to rally in a relatively short period of time Because management announced a  million share repurchase program investors should have another reason to consider Under Armour This repurchase amount represents roughly  of the company’s size which is a very aggressive program Stocks like Alibaba Group NYSE BABA announced plans to buy back up to  billion in stock or  of the company and that stock has delivered a more than  rally in a single week What could come of Under Armour’s  buyback is up for debate Last but not least investors should have financial stability in their checklist for a potential investment and Under Armour seems to tie this one together The company’s quarterly press release would show a net operating cash flow of  million in the past quarter compared to a net outflow of  million a year prior A stratospheric improvement in the company’s cash flows made management feel confident enough to buy back stock hoping this profitability would be sustained in the long run Before you consider Alibaba Group youll want to hear this MarketBeat

equity firm Permira's offer to acquire Squarespace in a $6.9 billion all-cash deal indicates a recovering financial market.,www.marketbeat.com,Key Points One way to assess the financial markets health is to follow the money Private equity firm Permira offered to acquire Squarespace in a  billion allcash deal sending Squarespace shares soaring nearly  Despite higherthantarget inflation at  the current economic environment is pushing investors towards companies with strong fundamentals as seen in Permiras confidence in Squarespace  stocks we like better than Squarespace One surefire way investors can figure out the financial systems health is by following the money Squarespace Today SQSP Squarespace    Week Range    Price Target  Add to Watchlist Shares ofare up nearly  after private equity firm Permira offered to take it private through a  billion allcash deal  Before this offer Squarespace had a market capitalization of approximately  billion So what could make this private equity fund willing to pay a  premium for this technology stock The simple answer lies behind the Federal Reserves the Fed plans to cut interest rates later this year It looked like the first cuts would come in March then May and now September according to the CMEs FedWatch tool Get Squarespace alerts Sign Up Forget the Noise Heres What Matters After a disappointing  US gross domestic product GDP growth in the past quarter investors should have become worried about the economys current state but that didnt seem to happen Low economic growth is expected to push the Feds agenda into cutting rates sooner rather than later as the economy needs a more flexible financing environment to heat up again According to ISM PMI readings the manufacturing and business services sectors contracted in the past month This is bad news for future GDP growth and may create another pressure point for the Fed to act more quickly than expected Inflation is another factor nudging the Fed into a decision For the past month inflation has been above the Feds  target and just came in at  Still relatively hot and with no prospect of slowing down toward the Feds target it may pose a problem for investors betting on interest rate cuts to come relatively soon However thats not the view at Permira as the recent Squarespace acquisition leads many to believe that the financial markets may not be as shaken as they seem Investors Want Quality Not Empty Promises Despite recent rallies in meme stocks those hoping to see GameStop Corp NYSE GME and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc NYSE AMC reach a new ceiling might be in for a surprise Because these companies lack one essential thing their recent rallies may be shortlived Squarespace Inc SQSP Price Chart for Wednesday May   According to the companys press release one of the main reasons behind the Squarespace buyout is cash flow which reached  million in the past quarter Even after capital expenditures of  million the company walked away with a free cash flow of roughly  million giving investors confidence that this business can cushion low economic growth and high inflation also known as stagflation This financial stance compares with GameStops negative free cash flow AMC is close behind with share dilutions being the only strategy to keep funding losing operations The takeaway Investing is cool again but it must come with solid fundamentals Better Fits for Todays Market Knowing this investors can find a much better proposition in Adobe Inc NASDAQ ADBE especially now that the stock trades at  of its week high today Exposed to the broader tailwinds found in the artificial intelligence space analysts are willing to bet that Adobe could deliver  earnings per share EPS growth in the next  months Aboveaverage growth is the driver here as these same analysts see a valuation of up to  according to those at Piper Sandler To prove these projections right the stock must rally  from its current price Another example of technology exposed to the bullish trends in the US real estate market is SoFi Technologies Inc NASDAQ SOFI When and if rates do come down cheaper mortgage financing could spark a new demand boom in real estate Because of this analysts are willing to bet that SoFi can deliver up to  EPS growth this year not to mention that Jefferies Financial Group slapped a  price target for SoFi stock calling for a net  upside from where it trades today The lesson here is that if investors want to beat stagflation today they must choose solid fundamentals at a reasonable discount anything else is just noise Before you consider

direct exposure to gold bullion reducing operational risks and providing a redemption feature for gold  stocks we like better than Sprott Physical Gold Trust Michael Burry the legendary investor who predicted the  financial crisis has once again made waves with his latest F filing While he added to and trimmed several positions the standout move was his new investment in Sprott Physical Gold Fund NYSEARCA PHYS In this article well delve into the highlights of this filing and why he chose to invest in physical gold over other forms of the precious metal Get PHYS alerts Sign Up Burry is the maverick investor who netted  million during the  financial crisis by betting against the housing market—a feat captured in the awardwinning film The Big Short—and is widely regarded as a prescient Wall Street outsider Since his famous bet he has made several notable trades He strategically invested in water assets anticipating future scarcity and bought into GameStop NYSE GME in  before it

Sprott Physical Gold Trust which now makes up  of his portfolio This move highlights his focus on physical gold as a hedge against economic instability and inflation Here are some key reasons why gold is relevant for any investors portfolio LongTerm Store of Value  Golds industrial use and limited supply make it a reliable longterm store of wealth trusted for centuries The metal also protects against the eroding effects of inflation  Golds industrial use and limited supply make it a reliable longterm store of wealth trusted for centuries The metal also protects against the eroding effects

deficits  Gold serves as a safeguard against potential Federal Reserve policy errors especially as the Fed is under pressure to cut rates amid rising inflation and public deficits Fiat Devaluation Gold hedges against the devaluation of the US dollar and fiat currencies in general offering stability when confidence in traditional money wanes The rise of Bitcoin also reflects this trend Sogold makes sense But why physical gold Investors have multiple ways to gain exposure to gold including ETFs gold mining stocks and futures There are a few reasons why he chose the Sprott Trust specifically Let’s find out why  Direct Exposure The Sprott Physical Gold Trust offers direct exposure to gold bullion providing a way to invest in gold without the operational and management risks associated with mining companies Investors purchase real gold stored in secure vaults which is more stable and less volatile than mining stocks  Reduced Operational and Management Risks Gold mining companies face various operational risks including high fixed costs and regulatory issues particularly as many gold mines are in politically volatile regions Investing in PHYS eliminates these risks as it purely tracks the price of gold without the added complexities of mining operations  Redemption Feature This is the key to Burry’s decision Subject to minimum quantity requirements PHYS allows investors to redeem their units for gold bullion a unique feature not offered by most gold ETFs A doomsday investor like Burry wants the ability to retrieve gold if markets are going through an extreme crisis In a scenario like that a regular ETF investor might face a situation in which the ETF issuers are in financial trouble themselves and may not fulfill their obligations The Sprott redemption feature eliminates that risk for Burry and other investors Burry made other significant changes to his portfolio in the first quarter of  He bolstered his stakes in Chinese tech stocks JDcom NASDAQ JD and Alibaba NYSE BABA bringing his total holdings in these companies to  million and  million respectively On the flip side he completely exited his positions in tech names such as Oracle NYSE ORCL Google NASDAQ GOOGL and Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Investing in gold carries risks particularly if inflation subsides The appeal of gold would also diminish if the Federal Reserve begins a ratecutting cycle For investors looking to hedge against inflation and market instability however following Burry’s lead could provide a robust and tangible store of value Before you consider Sprott Physical Gold Trust

It means to buy stocks on a pullback.",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Buy the dip BTD means to buy a stock on a pullback while selling the rip STR means to sell the stock into strength A multileg options trade can be used for the BTDSTR strategy selling a cashsecured put and writing a covered call upon execution A BTDSTR options strategy fosters patience and generates income with potential capital appreciation  stocks we like better than Dutch Bros Investors should be familiar with the expression “Buy the Dip”BTD when it comes to the stock market It means to buy stocks on a pullback Traders are also familiar with the expression Sell the Rip STR It means to sell stocks into the strength Fending Off FOMO Put together “Buy the Dip Sell the Rip” BTDSTR is what traders and investors should be doing buying low and selling high However that’s not always the case Unfortunately it’s all too common for traders to fall into the fearofmissingout FOMO trap and chase the rip buying high and selling low Waiting for a dip to occur can be tedious since its human nature to chase stocks when they are rising and walk away when they are falling Get Dutch Bros alerts Sign Up The BTDSTR Options Strategy Using stock options you can buy the dip with stocks and get paid to do so You can also sell the dip and get paid a premium once you buy it The BTDSTR strategy should only be used for stocks you are willing to hold longer It doesn’t mean you must hold the stock long but you are comfortable holding it because you are familiar with it and believe it will move higher in the long run To administer the BTDSTR options strategy we can break it down into  parts Buy the Dip BTD with a CashSecured Put Rather than place a goodtocancel GTC limit order on a stock you can use options to buy the dip and collect a premium for it by selling cashsecured put options For example an XYZ  long strangle is comprised of a long  XYZ  put option and a long  XYZ  call option Sell the Rip STR with a Covered Call Once you are executed on the long position you can collect income via a premium and appreciation by writing a covered call Depending on how much appreciation you want you can opt for a smaller premium for a higher potential price rise Remember the strike price is the price you will receive for your stock if it closes above it upon expiration Willing to Hold But Won’t Fall for the FOMO Let’s assume you’re a fan of the consumer staples sector drivethrough coffee shop Dutch Bros Inc NYSE BROS You love the products and selection especially the sugarfree options and the new protein

squarefoot store pumps out  million in sales annually Revenues surged  YoY in its Q  You have no problems holding it longerterm but refuse to fall for the FOMO The future of the company looks strong as it has more room to grow than Starbucks Example of a BTDSTR Strategy on Dutch Bros Stock BROS had a stellar Q  earnings release causing the stock to gap and go running up  BROS went into its Q  earnings around  gapped up to  and spiked up to  BROS is up against a double top resistance level trading currently around  There are  gap fill levels at  and  Let’s assume you are willing to buy the dip around a  pullback to the  strike level Executing the BTD Trade Since youre willing to buy at the  level and hold for a longer duration you can use the  strike price to sell a cashsecured put Note that cashsecured means you should have the capital in your account to pay  per share if you get assigned Most brokers will only enable you to sell a cashsecured put if you have the funds to pay from the stock The July   put option expires in  days and pays  cents This lets you complete the BTD portion of the strategy by selling the July  BROS  Put for  cents After you execute the trade you will be credited  in your trading account If BROS falls under the  level by expiration then you will be assigned the stock at  Keep in mind that you will still be paying  no matter how far under that strike price BROS falls This is the risk when selling puts There is also potential for early assignment if BROS falls deepinthemoney DTM However since youre a believer in the stock you are comfortable holding the shares Executing the STR Trade Once you get filled on the BTD order you can add the second part of the strategy to your BROS position To STR you will write a covered call with an upside strike price for capital appreciation while collecting a premium in the meantime Let’s assume that you already have a BROS position and now you will execute the STR leg of the strategy If your position is at  you can aim for a round number around the  strike price You can write the July    covered call for  cents This gives you a  upside for a potential  gain and a premium of  cents as a credit If BROS fails to close above the  by expiration then you can keep the premium and write another covered call again You can continue to write covered calls until you are called out Keep in mind the farther out your expiration the higher the premium you get paid for it Plan Your Trade and Trade Your Plan The BTDSTR strategy helps to avoid the fear of missing out FOMO FOMO is the alltoofamiliar course of action that traders and investors fall into when chasing a hot stock FOMO is the opposite of BTD because it is more like Chase the Rip Preselecting a strike price that youre willing to buy and hold on to a stock avoids impulse trading and lets you plan the trade ahead of time It also provides you with some income while you wait If you dont get filled by expiration just place another BTD leg of selling a cashsecured put at your comfortable strike price levels Once you get filled move on to the STR leg of the strategy and trade your plan Before you consider Dutch Bros

car are paid consumers will likely emphasize subscriptions The evidence behind this belief Financial stocks like Bank of America reported rising delinquency rates on credit cards with declining FICO scores At the same time companies like Netflix Inc NASDAQ NFLX saw  growth in global paid memberships Key Points Three stocks could become clear targets for investors looking to keep up  or beat  inflation in todays economy By deriving all earnings from subscriptions slight price increases could represent additional millions in the top line Analysts and markets expect a doubledigit upside because of this predictability and growth potential  stocks we like better than TMobile US Despite the US economy suffering from stagflation defined as low economic growth with high inflation consumers still find a way to fit these subscriptions into their budgets Because of this tendency investors could consider such businesses part of the consumer staples sector rather than the consumer discretionary group Get TMobile US alerts Sign Up Knowing that consumers will likely keep paying for their subscription memberships investors highly value revenue for such businesses especially amid an uncertain economic environment Stocks like Spotify Technology NYSE SPOT TMobile US Inc NASDAQ TMUS and even Netflix could prove outperformers in the coming quarter Inflation Protection Yes Please Subscriptionbased businesses not only achieve predictable cash flows making them easier to value for Wall Street analysts and more attractive for investors but they are also able to quickly shrug off the effects of high inflation by raising prices across the board With  million global subscribers Netflix could raise prices by  and immediately add nearly  million to the top line Likewise Spotify’s  million users could have the same effect on the company’s financials especially knowing users will try to avoid the pain of vibecutting advertisements Whether the economy is booming or busting people will likely always find a way to pay their phone bill because consumers won’t be able to prospect for jobs without a phone in the case of a bad economy With  million users as of the fourth quarter of  TMobile could justify a few extra million in revenue by merely keeping up with inflation All three of these stocks can protect their investors from inflation just by raising monthly subscriptions to their users Because of the quality and reliability of these revenues markets are willing to pay a premium valuation for these stocks measured on a pricetosales PS basis It’s All About Growth Steady

growth rates Based on an earnings per share EPS basis analysts believe Netflixs stock could deliver up to  growth in the next  months Spotify could be set to deliver  EPS growth this year which gives investors a leg up above inflation in the US and ensures that this potential investment could outperform the nations lackluster GDP growth of  in the past quarter In another doubledigit growth clip TMobile expects to deliver  EPS growth despite the inflationchoked US consumer Consumer sentiment declined in April bringing the index halfway to its alltime low However consumers still find enough

GMT","AMC looked to join GameStop in what could be the next chapter in the meme stock saga, however, investors will quickly find these rallies are short lived",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points AMC stock is attempting to join GameStop in what could be the revival of meme stocks Focusing on fundamentals investors will soon find out why these stocks fall under the meme category Facing severe dilution in AMCs lack of cash flow investors could be better off without this added risk  stocks we like better than Squarespace The meme stocks saga of  marked one of those historical moments in financial case studies Unfortunately it will be tied to those like the Tulipmania during the s Because the underlying financials of stocks like GameStop Corp NYSE GME aren’t that great tripledigit rallies in their stock prices spell nothing but trouble for those investors who buy into the hype What happened to GameStop in  could be looking to make a second chapter in history after recently hitting a trading halt after an  jump in a single day It is now day two of this rally and other consumer discretionary stocks linked to this meme mania have seen similar price action with AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc NYSE AMC being the next one in line for this historic rally Get Squarespace alerts Sign Up AMC stock rallied by similar magnitudes this week amplifying the market’s new ‘risk on’ environment and pushing for stocks with notsogreat financials into investmentgrade valuations However investors should have much more to take away from this behavior than just buying and praying for higher prices ahead on these meme stocks It’s All About Risk Perception AMC Entertainment Today AMC AMC Entertainment    Week Range    Price Target  Add to Watchlist During  barely a stock—or crypto—didn’t rally by tripledigits over a relatively short period The reason The Federal Reserve the Fed was forced to drop interest rates to near zero due to the COVID pandemic When interest rates are that low so are bond yields and savings accounts APYs Hence investors justify taking on a bit more risk to make an adequate return on their money Its pretty simple math Well it isn’t always good news as bubbles like the meme stock mania  and arguably Bitcoin  can form and that’s where investors need to be extra careful with how much they scrutinize their investment prospects Now that the Fed is looking to lower rates again those investors and traders who got used to easy returns may look to make a few bucks on the same trend repeating itself Still it may not come around this time A Different Battlefield When the Fed cut interest rates during  the economy had fallen to dangerously low levels of growth meaning that any stock with a decent earnings per share EPS growth rate for the year would likely draw enough buying pressure to beat the lackluster economic growth This time the US economy is suffering from stagflation defined as low economic growth with high inflation  lacked this high inflation factor meaning that EPS growth and healthy cash flow are as crucial as ever for investors to consider today And that is why AMC should spell out all kinds of red flags The tripledigit rally in this stock is due primarily to the influence that GameStop has had on other stocks considered ‘meme’ level So investors need to understand what constitutes ‘meme’ status It’s for entertainment really Investing in stocks that are hot and popular despite their lack of any profitability or ways to keep funding their activities is considered part of a gamble that will likely not pay off during stagflation times today it might have worked during  when inflation wasn’t that much of an issue A Better Point to Take Home Cash Flow Other areas of the economy could offer similar upside to these meme stocks with the added bonus of financial stability to carry a business through these stagflation times Investors could take Squarespace Inc NYSE SQSP as a recent example Private equity firm Permira offered to take Squarespace private in a  billion deal which is a multiple of roughly x the company’s free cash flow operating cash flow minus capital expenditures of course this premium multiple is justified considering the  fiveyear compounded average growth rate CAGR The stock popped more than  on the news while these are not memelevel returns they are justified by sound fundamentals In the case of AMC there is no operating cash flow to speak of and a net outflow of more than a billion in the past two years is far from justifying any investment in this meme stock Because a transformation of the movie theatre industry is unlikely to happen soon AMC’s current financial standing won’t turn overnight to justify today’s valuations They need cash to keep theatres open and no debt investors are lining up due to AMC’s poor credit profile so investors stand in front of aggressive dilution Over the past year AMC management took advantage of the high stock price to issue as many as  shares diluting unsuspecting shareholders at a massive level Unlikely to strike oil any time soon AMC’s lack of free cash flow will potentially require management to keep diluting shareholders even further

The Electric Vehicle Market Just Made a Sudden Turn,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/the-electric-vehicle-market-just-made-a-sudden-turn/,"Wed, 15 May 2024 06:33:00 GMT","Tariffs on Chinese EVs may not be as bad as they seem for BYD and NIO, if any thing, they make Tesla's recent dip a more attractive buy today.",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points New tariffs on Chinese EVs will make a new path for Tesla to take over the US marketplace on top of its  market share Despite this recent scare Chinese EVs like BYD and NIO will likely be okay as most of their sales come from China and Asia Analyst EPS projections and price targets reflect this view so investors have two ways to gain exposure to the new trends  stocks we like better than BYD The wave in electric vehicles has made a sudden turn The US is looking to support its car manufacturers and protect them from foreign competition to realize the real value these companies carry—no pun intended—under the hood Investors will find out why Tesla Inc NASDAQ TSLA could see brighter days ahead Raising tariffs on Chinese EVs American consumers looking at BYD Company Ltd OTCMKTS BYDDF as a cheaper alternative will soon realize that it is better to stick with what the market is already familiar with which happens to be Telsa today Tariffs on Chinese EVs stood at  but that ends this week and new tariffs will be raised to  for Chinese EVs Get BYD alerts Sign Up Investors still have a threeway strategy to get the correct exposure to these automotive stocks it depends on risk tolerance and whether they have the stomach to take on investments in China which has been pumping out nothing but negative headlines However that could change soon as economic indicators show a potential bottoming this quarter It’s All About Protection NIO Today NIO NIO    Week Range    Price Target  Add to Watchlist Some may oppose the tariff decision Still consumers will now be protected through domestic technology and assembly processes which are significantly more important when it comes to EV technology given its newness to the market Knowing that Tesla has been in the US longer than any other EV manufacturer it makes sense to cushion market penetration from BYD or even NIO Inc NYSE NIO However that may not be as immediate a problem as it seems Because the Chinese economy has finally recovered its inflation beat posting three consecutive months a whole quarter of positive inflation consumers may resume their EV purchases this quarter This is where BYD and NIO stock shine despite having to scratch their US plans This is why analysts are still willing to bet on a valuation of up to  a share for NIO representing a net upside of  from where the stock trades today Likewise BYD analysts expect to see up to  earnings per share EPS growth this year and there’s a good reason why Chinese EVs Will Be Okay BYD’s sales mainly came from the Greater China region with roughly  of deliveries versus only  from the rest of the world By the way BYD delivered a  increase in deliveries over the past  months bringing the total to  million making the company the leader in global EV sales The company will likely be okay despite US tariffs According to Dunne Insight the average EV price in the US is  while it is only  for Chinese units perfectly fitting into the Asian vs North American region As the US consumer has more disposable income not to mention a higher GDP per capita than the average Asian counterpart BYD and NIO could still see doubledigit growth by focusing on that side of the world At the same time Tesla keeps catering to North America Tesla’s Bottom Could be Secured Tesla Today TSLA Tesla    Week Range    PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist After falling to only  of its week high  Tesla stock could now become the most accessible buy for investors Considering that it dominates roughly  of the American EV market analysts have much to say about the stocks current potential upside Those at Cantor Fitzgerald saw fit to boost Tesla’s price target to  a share The stock would need to rally by as much as  to prove these valuations right More than that despite disappointing outlooks on Tesla’s first quarter  earnings analysts stand by their  EPS growth projections for the year The Vanguard Group is one of the institutions backing Tesla which boosted its stake by  bringing its total investment to  billion China Still Has an Ace Up Its Sleeve Also known as NIO The Caixin Composite PMI index a measure of overall business in China has expanded consistently since November  so the Chinese consumer may have additional disposable income to splurge on a brandnew EV NIO dominates among those with an uppermiddleclass income as the starting price on NIO’s most affordable model sits at  SUVs go up to  as the company targets the most comfortable luxury consumers which may take on water now that the economy is recovering As of March  NIO announced total deliveries of  a  increase from the previous

Del Taco segment contracted  on a  decline in comps The strength is seen in the margin Sales trends and refranchising impacted the company’s margins but lower SGA helped offset this The net result is

GMT","Alibaba stock is healthier than ever, despite an ""86%"" decline in net income, the metric that really matters enabled management to pay a dividend",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points After disappointing earnings Alibabas shares were down  in the premarket session Wall Street is hiding the facts as the companys cash flow remains as strong as ever as seen in a dividend payment and  billion in buybacks Citigroups analysts see over  upside in the stock a Chinese economic comeback could push it even higher  stocks we like better than Amazoncom Shares of Alibaba Group NYSE BABA fell by as much as  in the premarket session of May th the reaction came after a wild first quarter  earnings result which is arguably the most critical report of the year as it sets the tone for what may come in the following months Without digging deeper into the company’s financials any retail investor would be wrongly scared away After a massive decline in net income the stock should have made new alltime lows yet it remains within the tight range it has traded under for the past three years This means some are out there providing enough buying pressure to keep the stock from plummeting Today investors will get an insight into why Wall Street isn’t telling the world the whole story Get Amazoncom alerts Sign Up Behind Alibaba’s negative earnings release lies a simple  yet powerful  fundamental fact that will have the opposite effect in the following quarters particularly as the Chinese economy shows signs of a potential comeback shortly Taken as a proxy the iShares MSCI China ETF NASDAQ MCHI outperformed the SP  by more than  in the past quarter investors could assume that momentum  and sentiment  has improved for Chinese stocks Turning One of The World’s Biggest Ships Alibaba Group Today BABA Alibaba Group    Week Range    Dividend Yield  PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist China is the secondlargest economy in the world and plays a crucial role in global markets Specifically Alibaba is one of the largest businesstobusiness BB players in the technology sector  capturing nearly twice the global ecommerce market share thatdid The Chinese government noticing its stock market value decline to near decadelows decided to react and push future prospects back up Among the many stimulus measures applied to the economy the latest round came through a  billion bond sale Considering that there is enough demand for Chinese bonds for the government to consider selling them investors can see the growing interest from international investors in entering China However don’t follow this thread until all the facts are in One of these facts is the green light from Ray Dalio who—since the third quarter of —has been buying into the China ETF Michael Burry yes the guy who called the  financial crisis reports his largest positions in both Alibaba and JDcom Inc NASDAQ JD betting that China’s comeback will be led by consumer discretionary stocks first After posting mostly negative inflation data China has achieved three consecutive months a whole quarter of positive inflation which signals the potential return of consumer demand More than that the Caixin Composite PMI a reading on overall business activity has expanded since November  increasing the odds of corporate profits ahead However not all profits are made equal Here’s why Alibaba’s net income decline is a trick to keep Main Street outside this valued gem An  Drop But Not Really That’s right net income plummeted by  over the year which should have been enough to send the stock in the opposite direction of GameStop Corp NYSE GME which rose in the opposite direction on what could be the revival of meme stocks However following the potential Chinese economic recovery Alibaba shows all the right signs According to Alibaba’s press release revenue increased by  in the company’s largest segment Taobao  Tmall Group The most exciting business found in Alibaba’s cloud computing segment which competes against Amazon’s AWS also posted  revenue growth All others posted doubledigit growth in the digital commerce and logistics networks business As these mainly serve the Greater China region results show investors that the Chinese economy could be on the right track to stage a comeback this year Here’s where investors can justify Citigroup’s  price target for Alibaba calling for a  upside from where the stock fell recently According to management and the company’s financials the significant contraction in net income came from a net loss of roughly  billion in equity investments Alibaba Group Holding Limited BABA Price Chart for Wednesday May   Remember that the government had to act due to the dangerously low stock market Alibaba was on that boat as well However these results do not reflect the company’s true earning power which can be appreciated through the posted  billion in operating cash flow Alibaba’s cash flow has expanded since the COVID pandemic making this behemoth a total cash cow today The company’s current  billion market cap comprises  billion in cash What do companies do when they have more money than they know what to do with They pay dividends as Alibaba announced a  a share dividend for the year While that isn’t much of a reward investors are getting the bulk of appreciation through a  billion share repurchase program which took over a million shares in the past quarter alone Conversely if the Chinese stock market recovers along with the economy Alibaba’s equity investments could significantly boost reported net income Still

understands there is always a wait There will always be a wait even when ordering through the mobile app Mornings are the most brutal wait Starbucks attributes the waiting period to be a problem caused by its own success That may be one way to spin it the other is that the inefficiency is structurally and even culturally embedded into the process and its starting to seriously impact the

smallcap to midcap companies These companies tend to outperform all others during periods of easy financing and a ‘risk on’ mentality GameStop could provide investors with a wild ride though other small companies may offer a safer ride based on this rally’s influence Is There Substance to GameStop’s Rally Analysts think this chapter two of the  fad as a consensus price target of  a share set by Wedbush as of March  represents a net downside of  from where the stock has risen today Fundamentally speaking here’s why analyst sentiment hasn’t changed Following the company’s latest quarterly earnings release covering up to the fourth quarter of  analysts have good reason to believe the stock shouldn’t be this high Starting with revenue  billion represents a decline of  from the previous year’s  billion Yikes Here’s where unsuspecting investors may get tricked by marketing stunts and creative accounting The company reported a net income of  million compared to a net loss of  million

compare this to the company’s cash flow statement to really get to the actual business results Cash flow from operating activities was an actual outflow of  million Adding capital expenditures of  million brings the company’s free cash flow to negative  million If the company made a profit there would be no need to dilute investors to fund further operations Well GameStop issued  million shares during the quarter Now that the stock is becoming expensive again further dilution could be expected just as in  Investors could be better positioned by taking profits after this rally avoiding GameStop altogether or keeping it on the bearish watchlist for entertainment Now as markets are based on perception and influence here’s how GameStop’s rally gives more opportunities elsewhere The Return of The Mid Caps Aboveaverage growth at discounts is how to play the market’s changing perception of risk As buyers flooded a risky consumer discretionary business like GameStop other sound companies could see the same buying pressure shortly as the Fed could start heating up the economy again The driver US gross domestic product GDP growth peaked at only  in the past quarter At the same time inflation remained nearly twice the rate bringing on what’s called stagflation low economic growth with high inflation To get out of this the Fed may consider bringing these rate cuts sooner rather than later Based on these expectations analysts at Sanford C Bernstein see a valuation of SentinelOne inc NYSE S up to  a share calling for a  upside from its current price This target comes

Why These Companies Are Buying Back Stock Lately,https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/why-these-companies-are-buying-back-stock-lately/,"Mon, 13 May 2024 10:45:00 GMT","Three companies set aside billions to start buying back cheap stock today, management took from high profits to make this happen, as valuation point to rallies",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Three companies saw it fit to set aside billions to buy back their stock meaning they could be cheap today With solid financials and steady profits investors can rest assured that these buybacks are no marketing stunt Doubledigit upside lies ahead and the economic drivers behind each name are only likely to accelerate  stocks we like better than Apple When investors think about their potential winnings through the stock market two methods typically get the lion’s share of attention The most straightforward appreciation will happen through the classic buy low and sell high with a little luck Second dividend income has become a common preference during high inflation Focusing on dividends the primary method managements use to repay their shareholders may not be the most effective way for investors to get their money back In just a bit it will become clear that share buybacks are a much better way for shareholders to feel the love as they let investors compound their wealth more efficiently Get Apple alerts Sign Up Apart from being superior in efficiency share buybacks can send investors—and markets—a broader message If insiders are buying back their own stock wouldn’t it be logical that they think it’s cheap Suddenly stocks like AutoNation Inc NYSE AN eBay Inc NASDAQ EBAY and even Apple Inc NASDAQ AAPL may be on the cheaper end as management initiated aggressive buyback programs Buybacks Are the Real Life Hack Because dividends are paid with a company’s free cash flow operating cash flow minus capital expenditures investors will receive their dividends through taxed money Once investors receive these dividends they must also pay their share of taxes Why go through doubletaxation and take from the company’s cash balance when investors could pick the compounding route When management buys back stock they increase your ownership in the company as an investor enabling you to compound your wealth faster Ideally investors pick growing  and profitable  companies for their portfolios so when management decides to buy back stock they will own a larger piece of a growing pie Of course not all buybacks are made equal as some companies trick investors by buying back stock by issuing debt which is like paying your credit card with another credit card Three Companies Buying Back Stock Right Now It could be said that as the Federal Reserve the Fed prepares to cut interest rates later this year management is getting ready to invest in AutoNation’s future as cheaper vehicle financing could drive demand higher in the car market As the ISM services PMI index had its first contraction reading since  the Fed may have another reason to bring on these cuts and eBay management is right there to ride the recovery in the business services sector The stock market’s darling Apple is still the same

management analysts at Bank of America slapped a  price target on AutoNation stock calling for a  upside from its current price According to the company’s financials AutoNation generates up to  returns on invested capital ROIC so investors can rest assured that these buybacks aren’t a trick but are financed by steady profits AutoNation Inc AN Price Chart for Wednesday May    eBay’s Bears Went Running eBay Today EBAY eBay    Week Range    Dividend Yield  PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist After realizing eBay’s management will buy up to  billion in stock  the company’s short interest declined by  in the past month in a show of bearish sentiment retreat More than that eBay stock rose to  of its week high to let the bulls take over As stocks like Shopify Inc NYSE SHOP popped on earnings showing that the digitized economy is a new escape for businesses seeing their margins squeezed by the US stagflation low economic growth with high inflation analysts at Barclays boosted eBay’s valuation to  a share or  above today’s prices But that’s not all the Vanguard Group saw fit to boost its stake in eBay by  as of May  bringing its total investment up to  billion

despite facing some headwinds in its recent quarterly earnings announcement Investors know that Apple’s moat will likely get over this temporary bump in the road Hence those at Bank of America see a price target of up to  a share Apple would have to pull off a  rally from today’s price to prove analysts right Generating up to  ROIC in the past  months investors may apply the ‘buy and forget’

behaving lately—well saying it is a minefield would be an understatement Investors may have gotten—wrongfully—used to the easy money days of  when the Federal Reserve the Fed was forced to cut interest rates to near zero as a result of the COVID pandemic Low rates and cheap money have made just about any stock a winner in the past couple of years however that trend could be about to change

Altria Group Today MO Altria Group    Week Range    Dividend Yield  PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist Some investors would not support a company like Altria as tobacco has more than proven to

generated a return on invested capital ROIC rate of  in the past  months and that’s all investors need to keep in mind Over a long enough timeframe annual stock performance tends to match the longrun

coupled with alltime high home prices So what are these equityrich homeowners to do if they do not sell Well they can upgrade their current home This is why analysts at the UBS Group see Owens Corning stock going as high as  a share To prove these projections right the stock would need to jump by  but it could be more Compared to its peers in the construction sector Owens Corning stock trades at a  discount in its x PE falling under the sector’s richer x Like Altria markets feel pretty bullish about this stock bidding it up to new week highs recently  which also happen to be alltime highs  Price action doesnt reflect this doubledigit discount or analysts projections for only  EPS growth this year The companys financials show an average ROIC rate of  over the past five years making it an easy

valuation today, amid improving free cash flow, could drive private equity firms to give shareholders a buyout deal above $7 a share, a near double",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Peloton stock is now  below its alltime high and private equity is interested in realizing some value Despite underperforming a simple twostep process could unlock JPMorgans price targets Knowing how much Peloton is worth shareholders should accept no offer below  plus a premium  stocks we like better than Peloton Interactive Could the rumors be true Private equity firms are circling fitness company Peloton Interactive Inc NASDAQ PTON for a potential buyout The company has seen  consecutive quarters of losses and the onceshining stock is now  below its alltime high When the COVID pandemic peaked in  lockdowns gave gym goers no choice but to work out at home What better way to hop on that trend than to buy a brandnew Peloton bike with selfguided programs and an online community of fitness enthusiasts Get Peloton Interactive alerts Sign Up It turns out that this dream was shortlived as sales plummeted and expectations came back down to reality Now that the company holds toxic amounts of debt and its former CEO said no more after yet another disappointing quarter turnaround experts at undisclosed private equity firms could have a way to make Peloton great again It’s a “Simple” TwoStep Process Peloton is looking to cut costs by as much as  million by  which will come from the typical layoff strategy Trimming the fat through layoffs will do nothing if there’s no meat underneath profits so some financial engineering will be needed this time Layoffs will help but the actual root of the company’s financial problems lies in its debt structure Carrying around  billion of debt on its balance sheet Peloton’s liabilities exceed its current market capitalization of only  billion Of course in a high interest rate environment this debt adds unnecessarily high interest expenses for the company Investors can have one of Buffett’s famous cigar butts here as the company’s equity could be bought out at a significant premium when taken private for restructuring The world of buyouts works as follows Private equity companies will buy a stock today for around the price they expect to be worth five years from now at a reasonable discount for their troubles What this price is and what that discount represents is the answer every investor is looking for Hidden Golden Nugget Free Cash Flow According to the company’s financials the first quarter  results show a shocking figure Despite a narrowing net loss of  million Peloton generated  million in free cash flow operating cash flow minus capital expenditures Driven by better inventory management and the initial stages of these cost cuts investors can hang onto this figure to learn where private equity may start valuing Peloton But before throwing themselves into highfinance weeds investors can check public opinions first Peloton Interactive Today PTON Peloton Interactive    Week Range    Price Target  Add to Watchlist Wall Street analysts see a price target of  a share for Peloton calling for a consensus  upside from where it trades today Those at JPMorgan Chase  Co are willing to bet against the consensus pushing for a higher valuation of  a share representing a  upside instead When making a deal to buy out a public company private equity firms have to get through a wall of shareholder votes Knowing the stock could be worth up to  today these shareholders will likely reject any offer below this public valuation by one of Wall Street’s most respected banks Management could delay these buyout talks until consumer discretionary stocks recover As the Federal Reserve the Fed is looking to cut interest rates later

Shares Projected Earnings Growth Growing See Full Details Peloton’s distant competitor carries enough cash on its balance sheet  billion as of the last quarter  to buy out Peloton in today’s valuation so private equity has all the more incentive to make an attractive offer Considering that cost cuts could initially boost free cash flow further these newly available funds could be used to pay down debt not to mention invest in a better restructuring to increase the company’s valuation Peloton’s largest shareholder the Vanguard Group will probably hold onto this thesis before considering any buyout offer Over the past  months Peloton saw up to  billion in institutional buying with only  billion in selling for a net  billion or roughly x today’s company size According to CNBC reports working alongside JPMorgan on a “refinancing strategy” is none other than Goldman Sachs These banks wouldn’t give the company a chance if they didn’t believe this newfound free cash flow wouldn’t be enough to repay debts down the line This puts more pressure on private equity to deliver what could be a tripledigit upside buyout offer for today’s shareholders Peloton Interactive Inc PTON Price

the attention of call option buyers last week, and they have Wall Street analysts to back them through double-digit upside.",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Call option buyers think Starbucks Pfizer and Him  Hers Health stocks could see higher prices relatively quickly All three stocks are offering unjustifiable discounts to their week high prices becoming targets for options traders Analysts see at least a doubledigit upside through their price targets today backing these traders up Options are complicated and not for the faint of heart While some investors may use them to take on irresponsible leverage levels on their minor positions others could use them to express their predictions on a particular stock For these predictions to be successful investors must get two things right choosing the right type of option call vs put and timing the trade correctly before the option expires Otherwise the whole investment goes to zero Understanding these delicate facts can be enlightening especially when observing which stocks have attracted call option buyers this month Get alerts Sign Up Call options are a bet that an underlying stock could head higher in a relatively short period Considering this shares of Starbucks Co NASDAQ SBUX Pfizer Inc NYSE PFE and Hims  Hers Health Inc NYSE HIMS could make their way to investor watchlists as recent call option trader targets Starbucks Co Starbucks Today SBUX Starbucks    Week Range    Dividend Yield  PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist After falling by nearly  points on its first quarter  earnings results Starbucks shares are at an appetizing  of their week high Sticking to price action for just a moment investors will realize that the rest of the beverage and retail restaurant industry trades at an average of  of its week high making Starbucks an undeniable discount When stocks trade at such low levels relative to their week high there’s typically a good reason The coffee giant  known for consistently delighting its shareholders  posted a disappointing set of financials to start the year as US samestore sales contracted for the first time since  when Starbucks closed its locations due to COVID Of course this has nothing to do with the brand itself it is a broader economic issue After financial stocks reported their earnings banks like Citigroup and Bank of America blamed rising credit card delinquencies and deteriorating FICO scores An inflationchoked US consumer could also pose temporary headwinds However the market has remained bullish on Starbucks since this recent bump Despite a bad start to the year Wall Street analysts still see a price target of  a share for the stock calling for up to  upside from where it has fallen today Is this enough upside for traders It looks like it as unusual call option activity screeners caught Starbucks stock attracting a lot of them With the Federal Reserve the Fed monitoring inflation markets could be placing a bet on soonerthanexpected rate cuts which

sector added up to  jobs in April representing  of all the jobs added during the month With stagflation low economic growth and high inflation on their hands investors should pay attention to where the economy is still showing signs of life Knowing that Pfizer stock trades at a dismal  of its week high options traders flooded the stock last week on a bet that the bottom could be in soon Other traders known as bears didn’t even look to beat down this weak stock as Pfizer’s short interest contracted by  in the past month alone Analysts haven’t lost hope either as they still see a consensus

value investor checklist, and their small sizes keep them off the mega investor's radar, giving retail investors an advantage this quarter.",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Three value stocks could be a fit for Berkshire Hathaway if they had a larger market cap Ulta Beauty Bath  Body Works and Tapestry Despite a weakening US consumer sentiment and stubbornly high inflation consumers typically find space in their budgets for these beauty and home goods products With high profitability rates and low valuation multiples these stocks could provide smaller retail investors with Buffettlike moments Investors follow what stocks Warren Buffett buy However they lack a crucial detail in these strategies Buffett’s company Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc NYSE BRKA reported having  billion in cash last quarter so any deal under  billion would be considered too small to move the needle Value investors like Buffett seek out companies that generate high returns on invested capital ROIC or equity ROE preferring stocks that trade at significant discountsaccording to valuation metrics like pricetoearnings PE or pricetobook PB Get alerts Sign Up The type of large companies that Buffett likes to buy today such as CocaCola Co NYSE KO have gotten so big and strong that their valuation multiples never really fall to attractive enough levels for regular investors to consider buying For this reason smaller value investors can have their early Buffett moments in stocks like Ulta Beauty Inc NASDAQ ULTA Bath  Body Works Inc NYSE BBWI and Tapestry Inc NYSE TPR A Value Investing Formula Why are these stocks on today’s list It’s a straightforward filtering process Investors should look for at least doubledigit ROIC rates as annual stock price performance tends to match ROIC over the long term and a reasonable discount on a PE or PB basis An added bonus would be what Buffett calls a business moat’ ie relatively strong staying power among consumers Luckily for investors these moats are quantifiable through a company’s gross profit margins since solid brands tend to have pricing power over competitors Keeping these filters in mind investors can begin to see why these stocks make on our list today  but not Buffets as none of them have more than a  billion market capitalization Ulta Beauty Inc Whether the US economy is booming or busting skincare and makeup consumers always seem to make space for these products in their budgets This is why despite a contraction in consumer discretionary stocks weakening US consumer sentiment and stubbornly high inflation Ulta analysts still see  earnings per share EPS growth this year Ulta Beauty Today ULTA Ulta Beauty    Week Range    PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to Watchlist Ulta could be part of the consumer staples sector  providing

Like Ulta consumers always seem to have pocket change for home accessories particularly the ones found at Bath  Body Works As the US housing market hit a stalemate calling for inventory injections

What Is Earnings Season? A Complete Overview of Earnings Season,https://www.marketbeat.com/learn/what-is-earnings-season/,"Mon, 13 May 2024 00:12:00 GMT","Many beginner investors wonder, ""What is earnings season?"" Dive into the answer, why it's important for investors, and how it impacts the stock market.",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points Earnings season happens  times each year when public companies report numbers from the previous quarter The SEC requires certain disclosures from publicly traded companies however reporting requirements vary based on market cap and where shares are traded Earnings releases are often marketmoving events but investors must know how to decipher the data before acting The first quarter has ended which means earnings season has arrived and investors are eager to see results What’s earnings season Unlike football season you won’t need to upgrade your cable package or clean the grill However you will want to learn how to digest earnings reports and conference calls so your portfolio can built on informed decisionmaking Not every company has to follow the same reporting requirements Still the largest public companies all follow a similar script which means familiarizing yourself with lots of jargon and industry terminology In this article we’ll discuss how to play earnings season and what information you should be most conscious of when interpreting earnings releases Get stock market news alerts Sign Up Earnings season happens once per quarter when companies publicly release financial data These releases include data like revenue margins expenditures and profits and executives host a conference to relay the results and take questions from analysts Companies release earnings on predetermined dates so that analysts can join the call and ask questions about the data and guidance provided by executives While a single earnings report doesn’t always paint the whole picture these releases offer glimpses inside public firms machinery and can help detect performance trends Why Earnings Season Matters for Investors Companies don’t all release their earnings data simultaneously but they tend to come in batches after the numbers have been compiled from the quarter’s end Firms release data on their schedules without industry or sector timelines For example Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS BP plc NYSE BP Uber Technologies Inc NYSE UBER Toyota Motor Co NYSE TM and Robinhood Markets Inc NASDAQ HOOD all recorded earnings during the nd week of May Earnings season is a time for public companies to show their work Numbers are released and compared against analysts’ projections to see whether the firm underperformed or overperformed expectations Earnings beats exceed expectations or misses underperform expectations can outsize stock prices and investor sentiment Impact on Stock Prices Earnings data is released before or after market hours to prevent leaks during trading but that doesn’t mean the impact on stock prices is muted Earnings season is often the most volatile time for stocks because large beats can send a stock skyward while a large miss can send another plummeting The immediate impact can be fierce like when NVIDIA Inc NASDAQ NVDA posted an earnings beat for Q  and the stock gained  the following day Investor Sentiment and Market Trends Individually an earnings report doesn’t make or break the market However when taken into broader consideration a series of positive or negative earnings data can disrupt market trends and sentiment Suppose companies consistently beat expectations across different sectors or the market as a whole In that case its usually a good sign of economic strength which can embolden investor sentiment and create a wave of buying activity Investors can track earnings data using MarketBeat’s earnings calendar tools How Companies Prepare and Present Earnings Reports Releasing earnings is a multistep process involving both internal and external reviews Companies gather data internally for their balance sheet income statement and cash flow statement and review it through many procedures The company’s executives legal team and an outside auditor check the data before submission to the SEC The Role of GAAP GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles the set of guidelines the SEC enforces regarding earnings releases Earnings reports must contain certain data and companies must record items like revenue and expenses in a specific fashion GAAP helps standardize earnings releases making it easier to interpret and verify the numbers Commonly Reported Metrics To interpret earnings releases correctly you’ll need to understand these  metrics Earnings Per Share EPS  Total quarterly profits divided by total outstanding shares gives EPS which measures a companys profitability compared to its industry peers Revenue  Total sales for the quarter before expenses and operating costs are deducted Guidance  Sales projections growth estimates or any other forwardlooking statement about the company’s future performance expectations The Role of Analysts During Earnings Season What is earnings season without the analyst estimates Analysts who cover specific companies make earnings estimates based on publicly available data and past figures These analysts come from investment banks and research groups often from varied backgrounds and expertise This diversity of viewpoints helps form a consensus using a wide range of data and opinions Earnings Estimates and Their Importance Analysts don’t have access to insider information and are simply making their best guesses about a company’s future numbers The incentives to make a favorable estimate are also strong no CEO wants a bearish analyst to ask questions on a conference call However estimates are still crucial because they form a benchmark when aggregated The resulting stock price movement can be substantial if the company beats or misses the consensus view Strategies for Investors During Earnings Season How can retail investors use earnings season to their advantage Here are  strategies to consider when digesting company reports How to Interpret Earnings Reports Plenty of information is released during earnings and investors should focus on key metrics that can be compared to previous results EPS and revenue growth were mentioned above but you should also focus on profit margins how much of each dollar of revenue is retained as profit and any outliers like significant onetime expenditures Business language has a learning curve so familiarize yourself with industry terms before attending conference calls Look Beyond the Headlines Have you ever had a bad day at the office Sometimes public companies have a terrible quarter too but that doesn’t mean its a sign of things to come Earnings research often involves digging into the numbers to extrapolate more significant trends Compare figures against other companies in the same stock sector to see if the performance aligns with industry standards Review onetime events like chargeoffs or capital purchases and consider the broader economic scope when evaluating the data Consider LongTerm Trends vs ShortTerm Results Earnings data only covers three months of the year a very short time to form opinions about longlasting trends That’s why evaluating company earnings is a balance Investors want to see shortterm results because a sequence of good results can spur longterm stock appreciation However context is critical and investors must always consider how earnings data influences short—and longterm performance Conclusion Earnings season is exciting for investors because good and bad results can generate large stock price moves However for longterm investors earnings season is a balance between past results and future expectations Earnings numbers and guidance can relay how the company is performing and where it expects to go in the next year Still a single earnings release must be considered in a larger context to be useful for investors Make the Most of Earnings Season with MarketBeat Looking to boost your portfolio during earnings season Consider using MarketBeat’s tools and

still recovering from Wednesdays shock and hold the most risk but also the most reward  stocks we like better than CVS Health Savvy stock investors often look for bargains using the Relative Strength Index RSI This technical tool evaluates a stocks performance over the last  days and assigns a value from  to  Compared to many other technical indicators out there the RSI is easy to read anything above  suggests a stock may be overbought while one below  indicates oversold conditions The more extreme the reading the stronger the underlying conviction The past week has seen a strong rebound

Watchlist As a big and bulky defensive stock shares of healthcare titan will never have the agility or speed that their peers in the tech space do Because shares had been trending down through much of April their earningsinspired  plunge last week was unexpected The stocks biggest oneday drop for more than a decade came about after the company reported dismal earnings that missed analyst expectations across the board It didnt help that managements forward guidance for the year ahead was cut in the face of rising medical costs However with an RSI that dropped as low as  at one point in the past week theres a case to be made that this initial drop is way overextended With CVS shares continuing to consolidate above last weeks low and the RSI starting to rise its starting to feel like the bears might be running out of steam This might not be a stock to be backing for the long term at least not yet but we could be looking at a nearterm bounce back from the depths  BristolMyers

its shares rally all through the end of  and through much of March as well But a  plunge over the past few days turned what was a promising start to the year into a nightmare Making the drop an even more bitter pill for investors to swallow TripAdvisor managed to beat expectations for its Q earnings on Wednesday As is often the case the devil was in the details and the lack of any progress on a potential sale of the business was enough to send investors running for the exit But with an RSI thats currently just above  and a stock thats well off its low from Wednesday theres some serious bounce potential at play here To be sure TripAdvisor is not without its risks and it has arguably the most volatile shortterm prospects of the three stocks listed here but arguably the greatest reward Just yesterday Goldman Sachs reiterated their Buy rating and gave shares a fresh price target of  From the  they were trading at on Friday morning thats pointing to more than  in potential upside

Pelosi, as her Nvidia windfall wasn't enough, these could become her next winners riding on EPS growth projections",www.marketbeat.com,Key Points California Representative Nancy Pelosi after her Nvidia windfall has chosen a new list of stocks to be bullish on These stocks are part of a significant economic tailwind this cycle and they could potentially prove winners for her and those who watch Analysts see a doubledigit upside ahead for these stocks with EPS growth to back them  stocks we like better than Netflix When US government officials decide to take on a view for a particular stock Main Street investors could benefit by trying to figure out where and why these people decide to invest Today there is a clear technology sector preference on the part of California representative Nancy Pelosi Pelosi is now part of the ‘insider trading’ scandal after making a hefty profit on her Nvidia Co NASDAQ NVDA trades earlier this year According to records the government official made around  on her Nvidia trade doubling her annual salary While some may critique her potential access to privileged information most miss out on the big picture Get Netflix alerts Sign Up Her other  most recent  interests in stocks like Alphabet Inc NASDAQ GOOGL the Walt Disney Co NYSE DIS and even Palo Alto Networks Inc NASDAQ PANW all have a similar trend behind them Knowing where today’s value remains in the global economy Pelosi has chosen these stocks The Beat of The Economic Drum Will Pelosi be right again in her latest bets Only time will tell one thing investors can probably guess though is that she’s not far off the right track As the US economy faces a steep divide this year with the technology and manufacturing sectors diverging from their typical relationship her stock picks could see a fundamental backing this cycle After contracting for more than  consecutive months the ISM manufacturing PMI index left the spotlight for the ISM services PMI index instead Services have expanded steadily since  with only one contracting month in April  Because artificial intelligence and the chips and semiconductors behind it will be a focal point for governments and consumers this year the Federal Reserve the Fed may help the cycle along The Fed could spark a new bull cycle in services stocks like Pelosi’s picks by proposing interest rate cuts later this year One thing is certain however that her reasoning goes beyond this simple economic fact Google’s AI Race At Great Prices Alphabet Today GOOGL Alphabet    Week Range    PE Ratio  Price Target  Add to

once was More than that according to price targets analysts at JP Morgan Chase  Co think Google stock could rally up to  a share The stock must jump by  from where it trades today to prove these projections right After creating the Gemini ecosystem it is easy for investors to see how Google’s access to almost all of the world’s consumer data can be used through its artificial intelligence arm

broader economic worry within the consumer discretionary sector Understanding Investor Worries After expanding month after month since  the ISM services PMI index has fallen into a contraction according to its latest reading for April  Because discretionary spending and services stocks like Airbnb fall into this category investors may have gotten slightly spooked Nothing wrong with taking

only one contracting manufacturing businesses have also been contracting for over  months Because of this the Federal Reserve the Fed may consider cutting interest rates sooner rather than later even with stubbornly high inflation rates Rate cuts could push consumer discretionary spending toward Airbnb as it is directly tied to domestic and international travel budgets At the same time even if the Fed doesn’t cut rates rent inflation is reported to be one of the main drivers of the sticky US inflation rates experienced today Because consumers  in their right minds  won’t lock in leases at record high rates nor are they looking to finance a new home at  mortgages and an average home price that is now  higher than prepandemic prices Airbnb also becomes a solution for those looking to

Typically, a stock that beats top and bottom",www.marketbeat.com,Earnings season always comes with its share of large stock price moves that exceed  Typically a stock that beats top and bottom line estimates and raises its forward guidance tends to gap up and vice versa gap down when it lowers its forward guidance Of course the market can also be irrational and gap a stock even on an earnings miss and lowered guidance Trying to predict the direction and magnitude of a price gap can be futile However if you want to take that bet on a large price move in either direction then you can use stock options to limit your risk Namely you may consider an options strategy called a long strangle Get Roblox alerts Sign Up What is a Long Strangle A long strangle is a multileg options strategy comprised of buying  outofthemoney OTM put option and  outofthemoney call option with the same expiration date These positions or legs are taken simultaneously usually through a function on your online brokerage app If your broker doesnt have a strangle trade option then you can place the trades manually and individually First you buy the put option and then buy the call option For example an XYZ  long strangle is comprised of a long  XYZ  put option and a long  XYZ  call option When to Consider a Long Strangle Trade You can use a long strangle when you feel a stock will make a large move on an event or catalyst These can be scheduled events like earnings reports FDA advisory panel votes product launches or legal verdicts Determining the direction or magnitude of the price move can be unpredictable but if you are certain the price move will be outsized by at least  then you can take a measured risk with a long strangle trade Example of a Long Strangle on RBLX Time for an example a computer and technology sector video game and platform developer Roblox Co NYSE RBLX RBLX has a history of making large price moves on its earnings report The stock has traded in a range between  and  in its past  earnings reports Predicting which way RBLX will go upon its earnings release is fruitless The daily relative strength index RSI is rising to the band If we consider a  spread for a long OTM strangle we can use the  to  range or the  put and  call The cost of both legs needs to be added to the strike prices to calculate the breakeven levels Executing the Trade RBLX is currently trading at  If we look up the RBLX  long strangle expiring May   we see the  put is priced at  and the  call is priced a  The total for the  positions is  the cost of the trade or debit To execute the trade you just click a button that will simultaneously perform both trades at the  price If your online broker cant place oneclick long strangle trades then youll have to manually buy the  put option for  and buy the  call option for  The Potential Outcomes Upon expiration there are  potential outcomes RBLX can close at two breakeven price levels  and  The cost of the strangle trade is  We subtract and add the cost of the trade to each option strike price to derive the breakeven price respectively The  put minus  is  The  call option plus  is  The maximum loss is  This is the total cost for the trade This occurs if RBLX closes between  and  The maximum profit is technically unlimited However we can use the prior trading range from  to  If RBLX rises to  the profit is  and continues to grow as it moves higher If RBLX falls to  the profit is  and that continues to grow as it falls further It’s Still a Gamble But Measured The title of this article starts with How to Bet on a Large Stock Price Move The key word is Bet Any way you slice it a long strangle is a bet Some people call it a gamble while others consider it speculation since your maximum loss is contained in the cost of the trade Long strangles are an attempt to predict a large price move which makes them a gamble but a measured one

quarter  earnings results arguably the most important set of results as they set the tone for the rest of the year in any stock shares of Shopify Inc NYSE SHOP are plummeting by as much as  during the

manufacturing looks to be returning as it reported its first expansion reading for March  On the other hand services are slowing down to have their first contraction reading since  but that’s not necessarily bad news Of course seeing a slowdown all across services Shopify investors may have chosen to take profits off the table However a comeback in manufacturing can also signal a reset for services as the two typically go hand in hand And this time the Federal Reserve the Fed comes to push both these sectors higher through proposed interest rate cuts this year Initially expected to come

started his financial services career by moving through the ranks at McKinsey  Co just wrapped up his first  months as president of Mercer Advisors Asked if his early tenure at Mercer has met his expectations Gourvitch told ThinkAdvisor the answer is a clear “yes” noting it’s also been a great time for the firm too Client assets have grown to more than  billion while the advisor force has expanded to over  professionals as of March  The combined level of assets under management and under advisement has jumped  since Gourvitch joined the RIA A good part of the growth stems from organic sales and market returns but Mercer Advisors has also been highly active in acquisitions The firm has made some  acquisitions since inking its first deal back in  including several big deals revealed so far this year alone During Gourvitch’s tenure the total level of assets brought on via acquisitions is roughly  billion via  deals ranging in size from  million to  billion Key to the successful acquisitions Gourvitch explains is identifying firms with likeminded leaders and advisors who are able to plug into Mercer and build their scalability Overall he adds Mercer’s organic growth and its MA success depend on the firm’s differentiated approach to wealth management which has been baked in since its founding in  It unites inhouse estate and tax planning capabilities with dedicated employeeadvisors who focus mainly on serving existing clients not on attracting new ones The RIA follows a multitiered service approach which is focused on the expanding needs of wealthy and ultrawealthy clients its initial wealthplanning service has an asset minimum of  In addition the firm builds institutionalgrade investment portfolios for individual families according to Gourvitch who points out that Mercer is a fully independent fiduciary “It means we are committed to do what’s in the best interest of our clients” While he says there likely will always be a role for commissionbased professionals in the world of wealth management the jury is in that “full fiduciary is the way to go” Here are some more highlights from our conversation THINKADVISOR First can you tell us about your time at McKinsey  Co Was financial services your focus there DANIEL GOURVITCH I joined McKinsey straight out of college but I was actually introduced to wealth management even earlier than that because my dad worked in the space That was at the time when many brokerdealers were coming together to form what are now the big wirehouses which is an interesting bit of history When I joined McKinsey they asked what topics I knew about and had an interest in I shared that I knew something about wealth management from internship opportunities I had as well as from speaking with my dad at the dining room table So I started working with financial firms from the beginning and it was an year run working there at McKinsey I led our wealth management practice there and served UHNWfocused private banks wirehouses brokerdealers TAMPs and investors in the space Most of my research and projects were about this central question of what does the wealth management customer really want and how can we deliver more value to them Ironically that wasn’t actually a topofmind question for many firms focused mostly on sales or recruiting advisors My ongoing interest in the space really came from a desire to understand the actual value we were delivering to our wealth management customers and how we could build firms that deliver more and more value to them every day Then it was on to a short stint at both BlackRock and Goldman Sachs before you landed at Mercer Advisors right Yes after McKinsey I moved through BlackRock and Goldman That period was about my pursuit of finding a home where I could be involved in building a wealth management firm that is unabashedly about delivering value to the client I tell this story a lot I actually met Mercer Advisors’ CEO Dave Welling at a dinner about two years ago and I went home and said to my wife I’d like for us to be clients of this firm It obviously turned into a lot more than that It was the service model that stood out to me In my view we have quite a distinct approach that focuses on delivering value for our clients and bringing the full set of the firm’s capabilities to bear whenever the client needs it The structure of our firm has a lot to do with that Everyone serving clients is an employee We have a single PL statement We’re not splitting revenues and profits across team members of offices and then asking them to collaborate It means that we can genuinely match every client to the advisor who is best suited to work with them It means that when something happens in a client’s life we can bring

the trading process accelerates The T regime increases the chance of failures because the compressed timeframe makes it harder for buyers and sellers to ensure their funds and securities are ready The US switch also means it’s leaving other jurisdictions behind which is a headache for many investment vehicles operating across borders When US markets reopen next Tuesday after the long weekend everything will likely seem normal It’s only after the close and in the following days that any cracks are expected to appear A spike in the number of failed trades operational glitches and additional costs are among industry fears as the trading process for American securities accelerates with the time allowed to complete every transaction halved to a single day Spurred on by the original memestock frenzy the Securities and Exchange Commission is pushing the shift to reduce the chance of something going wrong between when a trade is executed and when it’s settled But the switch to what’s known as T comes with risks of its own International investors — who hold about  trillion in American markets — face a system in which the usual method of funding a US trade takes longer than they actually have to execute the deal Unheralded parts of the trading process like affirmation confirming details fixing errors and recalling securities out on loan must happen at least twice as fast Global funds face a mismatch where cash flowing in and out moves at a different speed to the assets they have to buy and sell And it all faces an immediate stress test as some of the world’s major indexes rebalance or reveal planned reconstitutions before the end of this month “All hands will be on deck” said Michele Pitts Citigroup Inc’s global head of custody data for securities services noting the likelihood of increased trade fails across the industry “There will be a significant uptick in settlement risks for the first several weeks” ‘Lot of Anxiety’ Under current rules anyone purchasing a US stock has two days between hitting the “buy” button and actually having to deliver money for the trade while the seller has the same time to supply the share This lengthy settlement period in such a large and sophisticated market is what remains from the days when transactions were manual and investors had up to a week to complete That’s been whittled away over the years and new SEC rules will slash the settlement time again on May  to one day Across Wall Street and beyond major banks asset managers and an assortment of specialized service firms are bracing for the fallout At JPMorgan Chase  Co internal modeling shows about a quarter of the currency trades it processes for clients are set to be impacted Brown Brothers Harriman  Co is putting clients through a “T simulator” to identify those with potential issues Institutions including Societe Generale SA Citi HSBC Holdings Plc UBS Asset Management Baillie Gifford and more say they’re either moving staff reorganizing shifts or building new systems — and in some cases all three — in preparation for the switch “There’s a lot of anxiety even just around the technology and the actual way by which settlement will take place” Amy Hong head of market structure and strategic partnerships for global banking and markets at Goldman Sachs Group told the Bloomberg SellSide Leaders Forum this month “There are going to be some mismatches around funding there are going to be some FXrelated issues that we’re going to need to work out” Hong said The world of finance and investment can be famously averse to change with doomsayers dependably appearing whenever new rules are proposed Yet in the case of T the concerns go beyond one or two market Cassandras Just  of sellside firms polled by Coalition Greenwich in April and May said they expect the T switch to go smoothly with  warning that buyside managers are unprepared and  believing trading platforms aren’t fully ready Almost a fifth anticipate a large disruption with “many or severe issues” The consensus view is that trade failures — when either a seller doesn’t deliver securities or a buyer fails to produce payment — are about to rise The question is how large and persistent that uptick will be Settlement failures are generally a tiny feature of the modern market usually stemming from technical issues or human error They can result in regulatory punishment loss of capital tied up in the trade and even — in very rare instances when the transaction is large enough — the collapse of parties in the deal The T regime increases the chance of failures because the compressed timeframe risks making errors more likely while at the same time reducing the opportunity to correct them Most crucially it makes it harder for buyers and sellers to ensure their funds and securities are ready The  trillionaday foreignexchange market is a flashpoint of the shift because currency trades typically settle on a T basis An overseas investor buying a US stock will soon need to either have dollars ready or find them within a day in an arena where it can take two Friday Fears From its Edinburgh headquarters over  miles from Wall Street the  billion  billion investment house Baillie Gifford has relocated two traders to New York and beefed up its settlement desk to help the firm stay active after the  pm US stock close Thanks to the T shift and a  pm deadline at CLS Group a platform at the center of the market that settles over  trillion of currency transactions every day that will become a crucial period for asset managers seeking dollars to fund their US trades But it also falls around the start of what are known as the witching hours in foreignexchange circles because of the famous lack of liquidity “If you look at the bidoffer spreads they’re generally tight throughout the day and when you get to the  pm to about  pm Eastern they just widen out” said Brendan Burke a managing director at BBH “It’s as simple as there’s less liquidity in the market because the banks aren’t staffed” Baillie Gifford has lobbied US regulators to get banks to extend their foreignexchange trading hours and to continue providing liquidity until at least  pm in New York five days a week Since moving its staff in January the firm has been trading as if T was already in force to ensure everything goes smoothly according to Adam Conn head of trading “It’s about trying to mitigate the additional operating risk which is falling on asset managers” said Conn There will only be a “very short window” after the US market close to resolve problems he said Friday afternoon is emerging as a particular area of concern because currency markets close on weekends meaning liquidity is typically at its lowest just before the US joins Europe and Asia in clocking off JPMorgan’s Brijen Puri head of global FX services said “neither the buyside or sellside really knows what will happen” in those periods following the switch “Once there is more data about what’s happening in that time zone that’s when banks as well as asset managers may decide on providing more coverage” Puri said “Like you have a night desk you may have a Friday evening desk”

How can I protect my investments from inflation?,http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/11/investing/inflation-protection/index.html?section=money_pf,"Thu, 11 Oct 2018 14:19:35 EDT","Whether you hedge inflation or look for a return that outpaces inflation, here's how to prepare.",rss.cnn.com,How can I protect my investments against inflation Even as your investments increase in value inflation can eat away at what they’re worth There are things investors can do to hedge the immediate effects of inflation or earn a return that outpaces inflation over time But it can be hard to predict “Afterinflation returns are the only ones that matter for investors in the real world” says Robinson Crawford an investment adviser with Montebello Avenue Even if inflation is currently rising more slowly than analysts predicted it’s better to be prepared Stocks Financial advisers say one of the most consistent hedges against inflation is a properly diversified stock portfolio Equities have historically outpaced inflation says Sean C Gillespie a financial planner with Redeployment Wealth Strategies says that while there is inherent volatility in a stock portfolio “equities are a longterm asset for your plan just like inflation is a longterm threat” To figure out where to put your money in the stock market investors could look to a total return strategy that relies on equities to provide positive inflationadjusted returns over the long term “Of course investors have to accept more risk when investing in stocks and endure periods when the returns have not outpaced inflation” says Dejan Ilijevski an investment adviser at Sabela Capital Markets “Although some investors may assume that higher inflation leads to lower stock performance US market history shows that nominal annual stock returns are unrelated to inflation” Gold and commodities Gold and commodities have been standard havens from inflation for investors “Traditionally commodities and gold have been good inflation hedges” says Stephanie Bucko a chartered financial analyst and cofounder of Mana Financial Life Design But she says it is important to take into account the US dollar’s strength as part of this equation “We like oil exposure as this impacts our clients on a daytoday basis related to gas prices but it also provides a good inflation hedge” says Bucko adding that we saw this in the s as inflation doubled and nominal oil prices skyrocketed But commodity markets for the unfamiliar can be complex and risky “Commodities are volatile more so than stocks which means that adding commodities to a portfolio may increase real return volatility offsetting the benefits of hedging” says Ilijevski Real estate Real estate is the ultimate hard asset in times of inflation since it will see price appreciation Financial advisers suggest investors find a place for real estate in a portfolio Investors can gain exposure to real estate by directly owning commercial or residential property or by investing in real estate investment trusts REITs Real estate is a sound investment says Crawford “But I would caution that if you’re not increasing rent in your real estate you aren’t fighting inflation” Short term bonds and TIPS Shortterm bonds and Treasury InflationProtected Securities TIPS are investments that are a hedge against inflation “Hedging seeks out asset classes that tend to positively correlate with inflation” says Ilijevski For example he says shortterm maturities allow bondholders to more frequently roll over the principal at higher interest rates This helps inflationsensitive investors keep up with shortterm inflation Similarly TIPS issued by the government are also a fixedincome security hedge against inflation Their principle is adjusted to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index When CPI rises the principle increases resulting in higher interest payments “TIPS absolutely merit a place in a US investor’s portfolio especially those with significant bond holdings” says Crawford “The main issue is that they increase in value in conjunction with the CPI which many would argue is not an accurate inflation measure”
How to catch up on retirement savings in your 50s,http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/28/pf/retirement-catch-up/index.html?section=money_pf,"Fri, 28 Sep 2018 10:47:28 EDT",Read full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,If youre nearing retirement age and your savings are looking a little sparse youre not alone Fortysix percent of baby boomers dont have anything stashed away for retirement according to a study from the Insured Retirement Institute which means nearly half of soontobe retirees need to supercharge their savings if they dont want to work the rest of their lives The bad news is that if youre in your s and are just now starting to save its going to be a tough road ahead to save enough to enjoy a comfortable retirement The good news is that it can be done and even if you cant save half a million dollars by the time you turn  you can put away a decent chunk of change — which is far better than nothing Picking up steam after a late start One advantage workers in their s have over younger employees is the benefit of catchup k and IRA contributions If youre under age  the  annual contribution limit for ks and IRAs is  and  respectively But for those age  and over the annual limits are  and  While thats a fantastic benefit to take advantage of if you can chances are if youre struggling to save for retirement its not going to be feasible to suddenly start saving nearly  per year In that case the best thing to do is determine what you can save set a goal for yourself and stick with it The first step is to create a thorough budget of all your monthly expenses to see where your cash is going and how much you have left to save at the end of the month This is also a good time to see where you can make cuts Be honest with yourself here to decide how important these expenses are compared to retirement Ask yourself if you absolutely have to be eating out every week or whether you really need to take the family on a fancy vacation each summer If youre especially serious about saving you may even choose to downsize to a smaller home to potentially save hundreds of dollars per month on your mortgage Once you know roughly how much youll have to contribute to your retirement fund each month start crunching some numbers Retirement calculators are helpful in giving you an estimate of how much your savings will amount to by the time you retire as well as how much youll likely need to have saved by retirement Keep in mind that these numbers are just estimates but they can give you a rough idea of where you stand and how long your savings will last If your numbers arent where you want them to be dont get discouraged Saving is hard work and beating yourself up over the fact that you didnt start saving earlier wont make it any easier If youve trimmed your monthly expenses as much as you can and are still struggling to save you have a couple other options Making the most of Social Security One option to consider is to delay claiming Social Security benefits which will result in fatter checks each month Youre able to start claiming benefits as early as age  but for every year you delay past your full retirement age FRA or the age at which you receive  of the benefit amount youre entitled to youll receive a boost in benefits For example if your FRA is  and you wait to claim until age  youll receive an additional  on top of the full  youre entitled to If youre already going to be strapped for cash during retirement this extra money can make a major difference For example say your FRA is  and the full amount youre entitled to or the amount youll receive if you wait until age  to claim is  If you instead delay claiming until you reach age  youll be receiving  per month An extra  per month may not seem like a significant difference but it adds up to nearly  over a year — which is a lot of money when youre trying to make each dollar count In addition to waiting to claim Social Security you can also put off retirement by a few years and continue working as long as you can This isnt the most exciting option but it can help you save a lot of money in a relatively short period of time Because not only are you continuing to contribute to your retirement fund as you work youre also not draining your savings just yet For example say youre  years old with zero savings and you want to retire at  If youre contributing  per month and earning a  annual rate of return on your investments youll have a total of  saved after  years While thats a good amount of money and far better than nothing it will likely only last you a few years during retirement If however you delay retirement by  years and work until  continuing to contribute  per month earning a  return youll end up with  And if you also wait until age  to claim Social Security youll receive a boost in benefits there as well If your employer offers matching k contributions you stand to earn even more by working a few more years In this situation if your employer matches your  monthly contribution bringing your total contributions to  per month youll end up with  by age  compared to just  had you retired at  Related links  Motley

3 reasons to retire as early as you can,http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/26/pf/retire-as-early-as-you-can/index.html?section=money_pf,"Wed, 26 Sep 2018 09:42:42 EDT",Read full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,Would you love to retire early So many people have that goal and for a variety of reasons For some its a matter of escaping a tough work schedule and the pressures that come with it For others its an opportunity to spend quality time with family and pursue hobbies Many folks however have a hard time with the notion of retiring early whether it be from a place of financial insecurity or guilt But if early retirement appeals to you on any level here are three reasons to go for it  You can afford it Many folks slack in the retirement savings department all their lives Case in point The average American aged  to  has  socked away for the future according to the Economic Policy Institute which isnt a whole lot at that stage of life When we apply a  annual withdrawal rate to that balance which is what countless financial experts recommend that results in just under  of income per year Of course theres also Social Security to factor in but the point is that many older Americans are woefully unprepared for retirement from a savings perspective If youre not one of them however then theres no reason you shouldnt feel comfortable retiring ahead of your peers Lets imagine that instead of being in your early to mids with roughly  youre sitting on  million instead Now you dont want to start withdrawing from your nest egg at a rate of  per year if youre retiring in your s because that formula is designed to ensure that your savings dont run out for  years and chances are youll live into your s and will therefore need them to last longer than that But even if we slash that withdrawal rate in half to  youre still looking at  per year in retirement income from your nest egg alone And that coupled with Social Security and other income sources might allow you to live a very comfortable lifestyle  You can still earn money Many people view retirement as a period where you stop working But actually retirement is the ideal period to start a business or turn a favorite hobby into a moneymaking opportunity If youre worried that you cant afford to retire because your nest egg isnt all that robust but want the ability to live on your own terms and control your own schedule then it certainly pays to quit your job and do something else to make a living instead And remember the more fulfilling you find your work the more motivated youll be to keep at it  Itll be good for your health There are studies out there that show that working longer can lead to a longer life Not only does going into an office offer mental and physical benefits but the social aspect alone can make plugging away for longer a worthwhile option to consider On the other hand the wrong job can easily put you in a situation where your work is harming your health Excessive stress has been unequivocally linked to high blood pressure and heart disease while being too sedentary which tends to be the case for office workers chained to their desks for hours on end can cause weight gain and other medical issues Therefore if you believe that your health will improve once you stop working thats reason enough to retire sooner rather than later Or to put it another way the longer you stay at a job thats harmful to your health the more you risk passing away at an early age and missing out on retirement altogether Related links  Motley Fool Issues Rare TripleBuy Alert  This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon in    of  People Are Clueless About This TrillionDollar Market Early retirement isnt for everyone and for some folks such as those without savings its a tough goal to achieve But if you have the power to make early retirement work for you it certainly pays to leave the workforce prematurely and enjoy the lifestyle youve dreamed about for ages

full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,Though retirement can be a fulfilling time in peoples lives it can also be a stressful one This especially holds true if you fall victim to the following mistakes so be sure to avoid them at all costs  Relying too heavily on Social Security Millions of seniors collect Social Security in retirement and those monthly payments play a pivotal role in helping beneficiaries keep up with their expenses But if youre planning to live on Social Security alone once your career comes to a close youre making a huge mistake Contrary to what you may have been led to believe Social Security isnt designed to replace your former paycheck If you were an average earner those benefits will translate into roughly  of your previous income If you were a higher earner theyll replace an even smaller percentage Since most seniors need more like  of their former earnings to live comfortably youll need to take steps to secure income outside of what you get from Social Security For the most part this means funding a retirement plan like an IRA or k during your working years but it could also mean planning to work parttime in retirement renting out your home as a senior or a host of other possibilities The key however is to recognize that while Social Security will help you pay the bills in retirement it wont be enough to fund your golden years by itself  Assuming your living costs will drop drastically Many people assume that once they retire their living expenses will magically shrink But chances are your monthly bills wont change all that much once youre no longer working Think about the things you spend money on today like housing food utilities and clothing These are all items youll continue to need when youre older and whether or not youre working at the time wont really matter You may even come to find that some of your expenses go up in retirement like healthcare and leisure In fact the Employee Benefit Research Institute found last year that roughly  of households spend more money not less during their first two years of retirement while  spend more for their first six years outside the workforce To avoid financial struggles later in life map out a retirement budget that accurately reflects the costs youll face and make sure the income you anticipate is enough to support it If not you might consider postponing retirement until youre in a better place financially  Not taking advantage of catchup contributions Many workers fall behind on retirement savings during the earlier stages of their careers when student loan payments housing costs and other expenses eat up most of their income Thankfully those who are  and older get a prime opportunity to make up for lost years of savings in the form of catchup contributions If youre saving in an IRA and are at least  years old you can currently put in an additional  each year for an annual total of  workers under  can contribute just  If youre saving in a k you can make a  catchup contribution for an annual total of  compared with  for younger workers Unfortunately many folks dont take advantage of catchup contributions and as such wind up falling short by the time their golden years come around In fact only  of k participants aged  and over made catchup contributions in  according to data from Vanguard If youre behind on savings its imperative that you take steps to pad your nest egg whether it be by cutting expenses to free up cash or taking on a side job and using its proceeds to fund your retirement plan Otherwise you may be in for a major disappointment when your golden years arrive and you realize you dont have enough money to do the things youve always dreamed of  Forgetting about taxes Between your Social Security benefits and your nest egg you might find yourself on the receiving end of a pretty healthy income stream in retirement especially if youve saved well But dont assume all of that money will be yours to keep Chances are the IRS will also be entitled to its share especially if your retirement income is substantial There are several ways you might get taxed in retirement First unless you have a Roth IRA or k your nest egg withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income — meaning your highest possible rate The same holds true for many types of pensions Furthermore if your income exceeds a certain threshold you could get taxed on up to  of your Social Security benefits Finally just as interest and investment income are taxable during your working years so too are they subject to taxes during retirement The takeaway Be sure to factor taxes into the mix when calculating your anticipated retirement income If youre planning to withdraw  a year from your k and you expect your ordinary income tax rate to be

5 things you must do before you retire,http://money.cnn.com/2018/09/17/pf/things-to-do-before-you-retire/index.html?section=money_pf,"Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:39:53 EDT",Read full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,If youre looking forward to retirement youre not alone Countless workers dream of leaving their jobs behind and enjoying the freedom of unstructured days But before you pull the trigger on retirement be sure to tackle the following moves so you dont come to regret your decision later on  Assess your personal savings Hopefully you spent much of your working years socking away money in an IRA or k If youre thinking of retiring nows the time to assess your balance and see what it actually means in terms of usable daytoday cash Its easy enough to look at say a  IRA balance and think Wow thats a lot of money But if we apply a  yearly withdrawal rate which has long been the standard that  translates into just  of annual income give or take some adjustments for inflation Of course that figure doesnt account for other income sources you might have at your disposal like rental income or earnings from a parttime job It also doesnt factor in Social Security The point however is to look past the figure you see on your retirement plan statement and determine how much income itll actually give you in practice  Map out a retirement budget Maybe youre used to following a budget and tracking your spending diligently While thats certainly a positive habit to celebrate once you stop working your expenses are likely to change — for better and for worse While you might save money on things like commuting and transportation retiring might allow you to downsize from a twovehicle household to a single vehicle thereby saving money on maintenance and insurance costs you might spend more money on things like leisure since youll have additional free time on your hands Before you retire create a new budget that details the expenses you expect to encounter once your career comes to a close Youll probably have to tweak that budget as you go along but having one in place will give you a good sense of whether your nest egg will suffice during your golden years or whether youll need to save more money before making your retirement official  Read up on healthcare costs We all know that healthcare can be expensive at any stage of life but you may be shocked to learn that the average yearold man today will spend  on medical care throughout retirement while the average yearold woman will spend  Ouch Worse yet these figures dont account for longterm care — something  of seniors  and over are statistically likely to need The good news however is that the more you educate yourself on what senior healthcare costs might look like the better equipped youll be to manage and keep them to a minimum Along these lines it pays to look into longterm care insurance which can help defray some of the astronomical costs seniors face when they inevitably wind up needing nursing home or assisted living care  Develop a strategy for claiming Social Security If youre like most seniors Social Security will come to provide a large portion of your retirement income But while your benefits themselves are calculated based on how much you earn during your career the age at which you first file for them can cause that number to go up go down or stay the same Thats why its important to create a strategy for claiming benefits rather than go in blind For example if you file for benefits at your full retirement age which is either   or  and a certain number of months youll get the full monthly benefit youre entitled to based on your work history If you delay past full retirement age your benefits will get a boost And if you file before full retirement age youll face a reduction in benefits but youll also get your money sooner Theres no right or wrong answer when it comes to choosing a filing age but what you should do is know your full retirement age and understand the consequences of claiming benefits at various points in time  Figure out what youll do with your time Though the idea of having all the free time in the world might seem appealing once you find yourself in that situation the reality might hit you hard The truth is that its difficult to go from a fulltime work schedule to a total lack of structure which explains why so many retirees ultimately fall victim to depression If youd rather avoid that fate come up with a plan for spending your newfound free time and make sure it aligns with your budget and income You might think youll go golfing twice a week and travel once a month but if your savings cant support that lifestyle youll need to come up with a different plan Related links  Motley Fool Issues Rare TripleBuy

get the benefit of real estate without tying up capital or getting dragged into logistics that come with owning property.,rss.cnn.com,How can I get the benefit of real estate investments without becoming a landlord Real estate remains a strong investment even with prices slowing But owning property can be a hassle A huge amount of capital gets tied up in a handful of properties And you have to deal with the logistics of holding and managing that home office or condo Investing in real estate is a great way to diversify a portfolio says Jeff Rose a certified financial planner based in Nashville But youll only want to have  of your portfolio in real estate he says Up to  that would be on the higher side Investing in real estate equity through ETFs mutual funds or real estate investment funds provides exposure to the upside of real estate appreciation But that kind of volatility isnt a good fit for everyone Another option is investing in real estate risk which comes with more fixed returns Real estate equity Real estate investment trusts or REITs are a common way to diversify into real estate equity REITs are publiclytraded companies that own incomeproducing properties — office buildings hotels apartment complexes shopping malls — that give people the chance to invest in the real estate portfolios REITs are a way to hold a variety of real estate properties as easily as buying a stock and provide dividendbased income But they come with a higher level of risk than say an index fund Any time youre looking at a publicly traded REIT which is basically a stock there is more risk says Rose They focus on one area It may be one type of real estate or it could be one geographic area and if that sector or area takes a hit you feel it Rose suggests taking advantage of the upside of REITs by investing in them through ETFs or mutual funds to further diversify your exposure The simplest way to invest in real estate is through a mutual fund or an ETF says Rose A real estate ETF like Vanguards VNQ offers investors publicly traded equity REITS and other real estate investments Similarly iShares IYR offers domestic real estate stocks and REITs Mutual funds are another way to diversify a long term investment strategy with real estate The T Rowe Price Real Estate Fund TRREX with  billion in assets is a giant among actively managed real estate mutual funds Newer online platforms like Fundrise Rich Uncles or Realty Mogul allow investors to get into diversified real estate portfolios for a lot less than the large funds Rich Uncles allows you to invest in its own REITs for as little as  or its new student housing REIT for example with a  minimum investment At Fundrise another platform with its own REITs the minimum investment is  Realty Mogul offers access to private investment deals or you can invest in its REITs which have a minimum investment of  While these can provide solid investment returns and dividends theyre illiquid and investors should not expect to sell quickly But online platforms can provide greater visibility into what youre purchasing I enjoy investing in the online platforms because I can see the properties that I am investing in says Rose Typically if youre buying an ETF or mutual fund or REIT it can be harder to see what youre buying And no matter how youre investing he says you have to know what kind of real estate youre investing in Real estate debt Another way to earn steady passive income through real estate is to invest in someones mortgage Using a platform called PeerStreet investors can back highinterest loans that offer regular fixedincome payouts A lot of people want exposure to real estate without that equitystyle risk says Brett Crosby cofounder and chief operating officer of PeerStreet We made it accessible and some people are much more comfortable with this level of risk Heres how it works PeerStreet buys firstlien mortgages from a network of private lenders Investors can search the site for investments and select investments based on criteria like term yield and the loantovalue ratio of the home The options are updated daily Alternatively you can choose automated investing by preselecting details that place you in investments matching your criteria Investments carry returns ranging from  to  and the typical deal on the site is between  to  months Other platforms for investing in real estate debt like AlphaFlow offer a portfolio of real estate loans rather than investments in individual loans While investments backed by mortgages are nothing new it was previously very difficult for individuals to invest If it does go bad you need a team in place if you have to foreclose says Crosby We handle all that We have taken an active investment and made it passive While the company is working to expand its offerings to all investors Securities and Exchange Commission regulations currently limit investments with PeerStreet to accredited investors For an individual to qualify as an accredited investor you need to earn an annual income over   annually with a spouse for the past two years with a reasonable expectation of the same level of income going forward Also an individual with a net worth exceeding  million excluding the value of a primary residence qualifies

5 steps to making sure you're ready to retire,http://money.cnn.com/2018/08/20/pf/ready-to-retire/index.html?section=money_pf,"Mon, 20 Aug 2018 10:19:46 EDT",Read full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,Dreaming of handing in your notice at work and joining the ranks of the retired Retirement can be wonderful — if youre prepared for it So before you put an end to your career its essential to make sure youre  ready Not sure how to do that Taking these five steps can put you on the path to a happy and secure retirement  Coordinate with your spouse If youre part of a twosome retirement doesnt just affect you its a profound lifestyle change for your entire family Before you take the leap get on the same page as your spouse Will you both be retiring or will your spouse work longer If your spouse is planning to maintain a career will you end up being responsible for more household tasks — and are you OK with that These questions need to be answered Youll also have to think through how your decision will affect your family finances — especially when it comes to Social Security benefits If youre claiming Social Security benefits early youll reduce the monthly benefits you receive for the rest of your life — as well as any survivors benefits your spouse could receive if he or she were to outlive you Devise a Social Security claiming strategy with your spouse before you file for benefits that maximizes your combined income as you cant easily change your plans once benefits have begun  Figure out where your income will come from When you no longer have a paycheck coming in youll need funds from other sources For most people retirement income comes from Social Security and savings A lucky few — mostly government workers — have a defined benefit pension plan to provide guaranteed income For the rest of us having enough money invested to supplement Social Security is essential To make sure you wont come up short add up all your potential sources of retirement funds — from pensions Social Security and withdrawals from retirement accounts such as ks and IRAs — and figure out what your total monthly income will be Estimate your Social Security income by visiting mySocial Security to find your benefit amount at full retirement age Once youre logged in theres a free retirement estimator to help you determine what your benefits will be based on the age you retire If youre not ready to create an account the SSA also has a quick calculator available to estimate benefits by inputting your current years earnings your birth date and your future retirement date To determine the income youll receive from investments you could use the  rule which allows you to withdraw  of your account balance in your first year of retirement and then adjust that withdrawal amount each year based on inflation However theres a chance youll run out of money by following the  rule so you may want to take another tactic such as following the advice of experts from the Center for Retirement Research to determine what percentage of your account balance to withdraw annually When you add up Social Security income income from investments and any other money youll have coming you can make an informed choice about whether its feasible to live on the funds available  Set a retirement budget and see if theres a shortfall So how do you know if the total income youll have will be sufficient to support you The best way to tell is to actually make a budget Factor in all of your fixed costs such as housing taxes and insurance Add up other expenditures such as traveling clothing personal care items transportation food and entertainment And dont forget to include saving Just because youre no longer investing for retirement doesnt mean you dont need to put aside money for other purposes such as home repairs or emergencies Your budget will reveal how much money youd actually need If it shows youll have plenty of income to cover everything youre good to go and can hand in your notice If it doesnt decide between scaling down your expectations for retirement or increasing your retirement income by working longer saving more and earning delayedretirement credits to boost Social Security benefits  Make a plan for healthcare One of the big line items in your budget will be healthcare costs Seniors often suffer from serious medical conditions and Medicare doesnt provide the comprehensive coverage most people believe it does Youll have to pick up a lot of prescription costs on your own youll pay premiums and coinsurance expenses and youll need to pay out of pocket entirely for care that isnt covered such as nursing home services Recent estimates suggest a senior couple in the top percentile for prescription drug use would need  to be reasonably certain of covering their healthcare needs in retirement If you dont have that much explore options such as working longer and investing in a health savings account or purchasing the most comprehensive Medicare Advantage and longterm care insurance available  Consider how youll spend your time Finally you need to think about what youll actually do during retirement Some seniors suffer health issues including depression when they lose their sense of community and purpose Have a plan to reduce the risk of becoming lonely and disconnected from the world after retirement Depending upon your interests this plan could include volunteering with local organizations joining a senior center babysitting your grandkids joining a travel group or taking exercise classes seniors can often join a gym for free through Medicares SilverSneakers program You could also do some parttime consulting work either for pay or through volunteer organizations such as SCORE

Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank a weekly guide to the highnetworth investor and consumer Sign up to receive future editions straight to your inbox The rich have taken quiet wealth to a new level turning to private purchases of mansions art and classic cars designed to avoid attention according to experts Auction companies and luxury real estate brokers say wealthy buyers and sellers are increasingly turning to private sales and offmarket listings to avoid social media and prying eyes While public auction sales are declining in the art world private sales — done behind closed doors between discreet buyers and sellers — are growing Last year while combined public auction sales for Sothebys Christies and Phillips fell by  private sales increased by  at Sothebys and  at Christies totaling  billion across the two auction houses CNBC reported in February that Christies had sold a Mark Rothko painting for over  million to hedgefund billionaire Ken Griffin even as public auctions continued to decline Classic cars are also seeing a shift to private sales especially with the most expensive and rare models RM Sothebys the classiccar auction company has sold trophy Ferraris Porsches and other trophy cars by public auction for more than  years But its newly formed RM Sothebys private sales division has seen its sales more than quadruple over the past four years according to Shelby Myers global head of private sales for RM Sothebys Private sales where cars are discreetly brokered between buyer and seller without an auction or public price now account for nearly a third of revenue he said Weve definitely seen a trend where people want to transact privately Myers said Discretion today is key People can buy without the whole world staring at them The rise in private sales for classic cars art real estate and other markets is being driven by social media technology and cooling prices for collectibles When a work of art or classic car comes up for auction the results and sometimes the seller are highly public spread over social media and blogs Collectibles experts say sellers dont want to risk putting a treasured item up for auction only to have it stumble publicly on the auction block Its very public now when someone loses money on a sale and no one wants that Myers said Up until a few years ago you could buy a car at auction and the prices wouldnt be splattered all over social media Collectors who like to show their cars at events and award shows are also shying away from auctions since viewers are more likely to be able to figure out how much the owner paid The car enthusiasts used to be a relatively small tightknit group Myers said Now when a major collector shows their car it spreads like wildfire over blogs and the internet And everyone can see who the owner is and what they paid In real estate many of the biggest deals in Manhattan Malibu Aspen the Hamptons and Palm Beach are now in private or offmarket sales Also known as whisper or pocket listings offmarket properties are not listed on multiple listing services or public websites but are shopped around quietly among a select group of brokers and buyers A townhouse in Manhattans Greenwich Village sold this year in an offmarket deal for  million making it the most expensive townhouse ever sold downtown A squarefoot mansion in Palm Beach sold offmarket for  million making it one the most expensive nonwaterfront homes ever sold on the island And Aspens first sale of over  million — Patrick Dovigis mansion on Red Mountain to billionaires Steve Wynn and Thomas Peterffy — was offmarket with the broker representing both the buyer and seller Los Angeles is considered the birthplace of offmarket deals starting in the s and s when celebrities and movie stars wanted to avoid overzealous fans visiting their listed homes Over time according to Douglas Elliman real estate agent Ernie Carswell in Los Angeles wealthy not but famous sellers have joined in on the offmarket craze Even the average multimillionaire or billionaire likes the idea of selling without the media and privacy invasion Carswell said Carswell said he currently has a billionaire client in New York who wants a special property in Los Angeles so Carswell is looking at a megamansion owned by a Middle Eastern billionaire who is offering it only to select buyers Hes also working on a deal in Palm Springs with a celebrity selling a home he didnt want to be publicly shown to a billionaire buyer who doesnt want any photos of his new home on the web They dont want burglars to know how to get to the bedroom or how much land there is or how to get through the hedges Carswell said I blame technology Carswell said offmarket listings dont make sense for properties under  million since they have a larger possible buying pool and benefit from broader marketing But for special megahomes in Malibu Bel Air or Beverly Hills priced over  million the list of potential buyers is smaller and most are already known to the brokers which makes an offmarket agreement more appealing That makes broker relationships even more important — especially to the wealthy Carswell said Never before has the need for a skilled connected real estate professional been more valuable especially at the high end he said Still some brokers say even for pricey properties sellers who go private dont get the highest price since theyre limiting their pool of potential buyers Theyre leaving money on the table said real estate broker Noble Black of Douglas Elliman There is a valid reason for not listing you want privacy and discretion But youre paying a premium for that Sign up to receive future editions of CNBCs Inside Wealth newsletter with Robert Frank

Morgan Asset Management examines how different ratios of public to private real estate holdings affect returns and volatility.,www.wealthmanagement.com,A new report from JP Morgan Asset Management posits that investors would likely reach the most effective portfolio allocation to real estate by blending public REIT holdings with private assets in core sectors The sweet spot offering the highest returns with more modest levels of volatility ranges between a  to  allocation to US private core real estate and a  to  allocation to US publiclytraded REITs JP Morgan researchers found According to Jared Gross head of institutional portfolios strategy with the firm institutional investors have long benefited from using private real estate funds to access core real estate sectors However using public REITs to invest in a greater range of property sectors helps diversify exposure to real estate as an asset class and provides added flexibility and liquidity Related Fund Managers are Bullish on REITs in  “Our findings suggest that a structural position in REITs of up to onethird of the total real estate portfolio may be advisable for balancing returns and risk while capturing the full spectrum of sector diversity across private and public real estate Gross wrote in an email For example JP Morgan researchers estimate that an  allocation weighted toward private core real estate should deliver a forwardlooking compound return of  and come with  volatility A  allocation should provide a  return with  volatility and a  allocation should deliver an  return with  volatility Related Why Some Investors Are Bullish on Private Real Estate Compound returns in the scenarios tested by the team rose as the ratio tilted more toward public REITs reaching  for the  mix and staying at the same level through the  allocation to public REITs However so did volatility which rose to  with a  mix and gradually reached  with a  allocation to public REITs The report’s authors noted this is because the volatility profile for public REITs matches that of other equities That is in part why they recommend an allocation that incorporates private real estate investments which feature volatility that is somewhere between that found in equities and fixedincome products “We believe that REITs should serve as a complement to private real estate not as a substitute for it” they wrote The report’s authors also recommended investors look at a calendar year of returns for private real estate funds to get an accurate picture of their performance Quarterly appraisals tend to smooth out returns and may distort the true level of risk present in these investments For example looking at the period between  and  JP Morgan researchers found quarterly data indicated private core real estate assets experienced volatility of  When annual data was considered instead the volatility rose to  However that figure was still below the volatility experienced by public REITs during the same period which averaged  based on quarterly data and  based on annual data In addition JP Morgan found investing in a global real estate portfolio rather than limiting investments to the US helped achieve higher returns since property sectors can perform differently based on local dynamics For example office buildings in Asia Pacific have had a much more robust postpandemic recovery As a result of that and similar trends JP Morgan expects forwardlooking compound returns averaging about  for global REITs compared to the  return expectation for US REITs
Unpacking the Firestorm Over Blackstone&#039;s Real Estate Valuations,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/unpacking-firestorm-over-blackstones-real-estate-valuations,"Wed, 08 May 2024 19:26:00 +0000",A recent New York Times article suggested that Blackstone&#039;s non-traded REIT is inflating its property valuations. But real estate industry insiders say they are not worried.,www.wealthmanagement.com,Investment analysis tends to be only as good as the expertise of its sources Regarding commercial real estate some of the biggest misconceptions held by people outside the industry include the assumption that all commercial properties are created equal and that office buildings make up the bulk of the commercial real estate sector In reality offices are about  of the market Over the past two years this has led to panicked headlines about the crisis in commercial real estate while in reality the distress has been concentrated mainly in the office sector In the latest spin on this genre The New York Times ran a story earlier this week that questioned portfolio valuations of Blackstone’s nontraded REIT BREIT Other outlets picked up the news running headlines that included “Inside the Growing Alarm Over Blackstone’s BREIT Real Estate Fund” and “Veteran Analysts Say the World’s Biggest Private Equity Firm Could Be In Big Trouble” The New York Times article focused primarily on how Blackstone comes up with valuations for BREIT given that the discounts it posted over the past few years have been minimal compared to over  decline in NAVs for publiclytraded REITs between  and today according to consensus analyst estimates The authors zeroed in on the fact that while BREIT uses a thirdparty appraiser and an independent auditor to appraise its properties the final valuation is determined after its own advisor reviews it Blackstone published an update to its stockholders this week that included a section addressing its valuation process It highlighted that its valuation process and disclosures adhere to guidance from the SEC FINRA and Institute for Portfolio Alternatives In addition We believe there is no better affirmation of the rigor of our valuations than the fact that in the last two years BREIT has sold B of assets at an average  premium to carrying values generating over B of profit for our investors Related Why Some Investors Are Bullish on Private Real Estate Our process requires us to use monthly property valuations that have been assured by a thirdparty we have never overridden these in BREIT’s history a Blackstone spokesperson said We stand by our rigorous valuation process which is virtually identical to the one we use for our openended institutional vehicles and has been validated by  billion of assets sold at a premium to NAV since  However according to Luke Schmidt senior financial analyst with management consulting firm Blue Vault Partners BREIT is not the only nontraded REIT that uses that approach For example the Starwood REIT SREIT prospectus contains the same language about retaining the authority to override thirdparty valuations as BREIT’s Schmidt noted Related WMRE Common Area Exploring Private Real Estate as an Alternative Investment With Jay Miller In fact BREIT’s property valuations might be incorporating higher discounts compared to its peers in the nontraded REIT space he said For example while BREIT uses a  cap rate for its multifamily properties JLL Income Property Trust uses a cap rate of  and SREIT a cap rate of  Meanwhile while BREIT uses a cap rate of  for its industrial properties SREIT JLL Income Property Trust and Ares Industrial REIT all estimate the cap rate as averaging  In its recent note to shareholders BREIT noted that it “widened assumed exit cap rates in its core sectors of rental housing and industrial by  and discount rates by  in each case reducing asset values since December   We believe BREIT’s valuation assumptions were adjusted more quickly and are more conservative than nonlisted REIT peers” While it might make sense to examine BREIT’s valuation methods more closely “to say something is truly wrong might be a stretch” Schmidt wrote in an email “I don’t see a real issue in how they are valuing these properties” he added “BREIT is also the most diversified REIT in the industry just due to how big it is compared to all the others The other funds that are more specialized or less diversified are naturally going to see more drastic changes in their values if those particular sectors are impacted one way or another” Similarly Kevin T Gannon chairman and CEO of investment banking firm Robert A Stanger  Company Inc noted that the cap rates BREIT disclosed for each asset class it owns fall within the range of valuations published in survey data used by commercial real estate professionals For example in March cap rates on closed transactions involving multifamily properties averaged  according to research firm MSCI Real Assets indicating significantly higher valuations than those listed by BREIT Cap rates on transactions involving industrial properties averaged  “We can’t say they priced it incorrectly” Gannon said “They do seem to fall within market parameters” In addition BREIT’s portfolio carries a high concentration of properties in highgrowth sectors he noted Eightyseven percent of BREIT’s properties are distributed across three sectors multifamily rentals including apartment buildings student housing singlefamily rentals and affordable housing industrial and data centers The remainder is split between net lease assets  office  hospitality and retail both  and selfstorage  The portfolio currently has an occupancy rate of  It has a leverage ratio of  with  of its financing coming from fixedrate loans and the remaining  from floatingrate debt Yeartodate BREIT posted a total net return of  including  in March While industry insiders expect apartment rentals and industrial properties to experience shortterm drops in demand because of the outsized volume of new construction coming on the market over the next year there are few concerns about their longterm performance prospects Over the year ending in March the industrial property price index tracked by MSCI Real Assets posted an increase of  Apartment properties fared worse with a drop of  but prices on apartment buildings remained  above their prepandemic level MSCI researchers wrote Industrial and apartment properties also accounted for the lowest volumes of distress including bankruptcies loan defaults and court administrations in the commercial real estate universe in the first quarter Out of  billion in distressed situations industrial assets accounted for slightly over  billion and apartment buildings for  billion MSCI Real Assets reported According to a recent Seeking Alpha note on private REITs authored by Brad Thomas and Christopher Volk BREITs’ is a “large diverse portfolio broadly centered in Sunbelt states with  of the rents derived from three sectors prized for their reliability that unsurprisingly also rank among the most highly valued in the publiclytraded REIT space” One of the questions The New York Times posed about BREIT’s strategy asked why it has not disposed of significant amounts of apartment or industrial properties recently However property owners not experiencing distress or an unforeseen need for cash generally do not sell assets in a market with discounted values While BREIT did sell some assets in  to meet its redemption requests “my assumption is that they would want to hang on to these asset classes as long as possible since they are performing the best and are expected to continue with high performance in the near future” wrote Schmidt Broader market trends bear this out In the first quarter investment sales of apartment buildings declined by  yearoveryear MSCI Real Assets reported Sales of industrial properties were down  According to Gannon investors and financial advisors indeed feel that BREIT might be overpriced as evidenced by the fact that inflows haven’t outpaced outflows in the first quarter Brad Thomas in his Seeking Apha note argues that redeeming might be the right move since publiclytraded REITs might offer investors more for their money But the company has been meeting its redemptions and has not gated them Gannon said “Investors have the last say” he noted However Blackstone has responded well in his view “They are standing in there they are handling the redemptions”

Billionaire Stephen Ross Believes in South Florida—and Is Spending Big to Transform It,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/real-estate/billionaire-stephen-ross-believes-south-florida-and-spending-big-transform-it,"Mon, 29 Apr 2024 15:26:00 +0000",The Related Cos. founder is following the money flowing south by bringing his influence to everything from real estate to schools and health care.,www.wealthmanagement.com,Bloomberg Markets  Some of Florida’s most prominent names gathered at an oceanfront Palm Beach mansion this month to raise money for a tantalizing prospect building a local outpost of Nashville’s Vanderbilt University an institution that would add educational prestige to an area booming with newcomers The guest list was a who’s who of state politics and finance including Governor Ron DeSantis and activist investor Nelson Peltz according to people familiar with the matter The host and owner of the s estate the billionaire real estate developer Stephen Ross loomed above it all Related Cathie Wood Reshapes Florida City in Image of Her BoomBust Fund The Related Cos founder best known as the mastermind behind New York’s Hudson Yards complex had no prior affiliation with Vanderbilt He was a relatively new resident of the Sunshine State having spent the bulk of his career in Manhattan Yet bringing a renowned university to nearby West Palm Beach would be a key piece to one of his most ambitious bets yet In what’s likely to be the capstone to his career the yearold Ross is going allin on West Palm—and South Florida—as a new power center After joining the mass of New Yorkers who moved south during the Covid pandemic to embrace the state’s sunny climate and low taxes he’s reshaping the city with shiny new towers while also trying to transform the entire region Related Palm Beach Tops List of US Cities with Most Passive Income The meticulously landscaped palm treelined streets of West Palm’s downtown already reflect his dominance Related has amassed almost half of the office stock A new story glassandterracotta building houses the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Steve Cohen’s Point Asset Management fresh arrivals to the block Soon an even taller waterfront tower is opening with office rents rivaling those at top Manhattan skyscrapers Further south is a condo development with units starting at  million in a city once meant for the working class who served Palm Beach’s wealthy A pedestrian and outdoorfriendly environment along with the nearby Brightline highspeed rail stop makes for an airy onlyinFlorida feeling for Northeast transplants If all goes to plan Related will soon build a story convention center hotel Ross wants to bring healthcare facilities and primary schools along with the proposed Vanderbilt graduate campus for business and computing students “This is just the start of something and creating something that will be much much bigger than people can envision today” Ross says from Related’s headquarters in New York where he spends far less of his time these days “I want to make West Palm a model city for the country” The pandemic exodus of wealth from New York and other major cities lifted few US regions more than South Florida Miami the state’s cultural and economic center has been booming thanks to an inflow of tech and crypto companies and the arrival of financier Ken Griffin who’s poured millions into real estate and local politics But for all the focus on the Citadel founder Ross is arguably the billionaire reshaping the region at the most frenetic pace with his efforts about  miles  kilometers to the north Ross with an estimated fortune of  billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index has spent much of his life fixated on overhauling entire neighborhoods building carefully curated mixeduse developments where affluent people can live work and play He sees West Palm as something bigger a chance to build a thriving community and finance hub That involves a myriad of challenges outside his traditional realm of expertise some of which stretch far beyond what money can solve The South Florida migration boom has tapered and Palm Beach County lacks the infrastructure needed to sustain a new flood of workers Some companies have had a hard time enticing young talent to relocate While highlevel managers might be able to afford multimilliondollar homes in the area the options are far more limited for midcareer workers who are relocating with families New York finance workers are having trouble finding public and private schools that suit them And the joke among locals was that if you got sick you’re better off getting on a plane than going to a nearby hospital “It’s very hard to change a social system—it’s much easier to change a physical system” says Mitchell Moss a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University “You can’t change a culture by bringing in institutions They have to be grown and nurtured over time” But to Ross who founded Related five decades ago and built it into a property giant with a  billion portfolio West Palm could be one of the most attractive communities in the country “This is more like citybuilding and it’s complex and challenging” he says “And I still love a challenge” Ross has roots in South Florida that date back to high school Born in Detroit he came from a modest upbringing with a homemaker mother and a father who was an inventor who never found success Hes cited his uncle Max Fisher the Detroit oil magnate and philanthropist as a business role model The family moved to Miami Beach when Ross was a teenager to help manage a hotel As Ross went on to create Related first as an affordablehousing developer in New York he kept his Florida ties He’s owned a Palm Beach home for several decades and controls the National Football League’s Miami Dolphins It wasn’t until the pandemic that Ross officially relocated seeing the potential of a “gold rush” in West Palm Richer Palm Beach had long overshadowed its western neighbor just across the waterway home to multimilliondollar estates owned by billionaires such as Griffin Paul Tudor Jones and Stephen Schwarzman—not to mention former President Donald Trump West Palm by contrast is more urban and less affluent historically drawing retirees and snowbirds Much of the downtown was undeveloped until Related first came to the area in the s with a mixeduse project known as CityPlace which had its own struggles and fell into distress after the global financial crisis Even now as luxury condos rise and New York staples such as Harry’s arrive to serve the new class of power brokers midscale chains such as the Cheesecake Factory and a Publix grocery store sit on nearby blocks Major finance firms attracted to Florida’s low taxes followed New Yorkers fleeing to the area during the pandemic Palm Beach County had a  billion net gain in adjusted gross income from  to  the most in the US according to the Washingtonbased Economic Innovation Group Manhattan’s home of New York County had  billion of outflows the biggest loss Related was already planning a  million investment to transform CityPlace But Ross noticed that an ultraluxury condo tower called the Bristol opened in  quickly sold out His offices at  Rosemary which was also planned prior to Covid started to fill at strong rents “All of a sudden when I saw what was happening with Covid and saw how they were renting I said ‘There’s a real opportunity here’” he says “We seized the moment” It was an opportune time for a move Ross had stepped aside as chief executive officer of Related in  and is now chairman with CEO Jeff Blau and President Bruce Beal largely running daytoday operations But the founder still has his corner office on the rd floor of Related’s  Hudson Yards headquarters with walls adorned with awards and personal photos while two guitars sit in the corner—one with Miami Dolphins labeling Unhung pictures including a frame with a “Ross ” jersey sit on the floor nearby As with Palm Beach Ross saw Hudson Yards as a legacymaking project he still has a picture of the complex on his phone case The  billion development—the most expensive mixeduse private project in American history—essentially created an office district on Manhattan’s far west side It was the result of more than a decade of at times fraught development transforming a once gritty stretch of railroad tracks into offices condos and a highend mall Ross says it was a liveworkplay project at a scale “unknown to mankind” Hudson Yards is generally viewed as a huge success commercially having lured tenants including KKR  Co BlackRock Inc and Meta Platforms Inc But some New Yorkers say it’s designed to appeal to the richest residents and tourists The second phase of the development is up in the air Related had initially pitched mostly housing in the area but sales of the condos in their first phase were slower than expected and building offices is now a risky bet The latest plan involves competing against a handful of developers for one of three casino licenses in downstate New York Ross though has moved on from his signature project saying he’s “left it largely to Jeff” He acknowledges that New York will always remain a hot spot for young talent drawn to the city But he’s quick to praise Florida’s lack of state income tax businessfriendly politicians and ease of living In a challenge for attracting some New Yorkers Florida has shifted sharply into conservative politics and its policies toward education LGBTQ rights and abortion have drawn criticism from some parts of corporate America Ross supported Trump in  and hosted a fundraiser for him in  with tickets costing as much as  but has since distanced himself from the former president He says that the political dynamics of Florida are “excellent” and that DeSantis is doing a great job as governor “It’s very attractive for people to relocate” Ross says “You don’t have to be in the Northeast and pay the taxes and put up with the environment” Ross has tried expanding in Miami since the pandemic as well but with more rocky results Related and partner Swire Properties pitched what would’ve been one of the tallest office towers in the state But they have yet to sign a major tenant and the development is now stalled A Related spokesperson said the firm is still actively working on the project and is in talks with a number of potential tenants Ross also dropped plans for a Frank Gehrydesigned hotel and luxury residences in Miami Beach after voters rejected the zoning changes he requested Related’s head of Miami Jordan Bargas has relocated to West Palm If Miami is Florida’s Manhattan Ross likens West Palm to Greenwich Connecticut the tony suburb that’s home to hedge funds and wealthy finance workers As of the first quarter Related was building nearly twothirds of the roughly  square feet of offices under development in downtown West Palm according to brokerage firm Avison Young The scale is tiny by New York standards—the Empire State Building alone has about  million square feet—but massive for the Florida city which has only about  million square feet of existing space downtown “We could not have imagined that Goldman Sachs would be signing a lease to be in West Palm Beach—that was beyond the realm of possibilities prepandemic” says Mayor Keith James who took office in  “Steve Ross is a tremendous visionary and he could see things that others cannot” Related’s latest office project One Flagler has landed tenants including HighPost Capital and a firm tied to billionaire John Paulson The developer is in talks to open a location of Eataly the Italian food marketplace in West Palm according to a person with knowledge of the plans Spokespeople for Related and Eataly declined to comment Other developers are following with their own Manhattanlike offerings Richard Born one of New York’s biggest hotel owners is investing in Nora a acre mixeduse development just north of Related’s Square with leases signed by foodie favorites Van Leeuwen Ice Cream and HH Bagels Florida’s Related Group which is owned by one of Ross’ best friends longtime business partner Jorge Prez is planning a RitzCarltonbranded condo development Ross was part owner of Related Group until  when he sold his stake to Prez’s family a move that allows Ross to pursue projects across the region more freely “To attract the highend companies that bring in highpaying jobs we have to provide a complete lifestyle to the workers of those companies” Prez says The Florida boom though is showing signs of petering out The sharp rise in interest rates has sent the US commercial real estate market into turmoil and increased the cost of financing projects The state one of the most vulnerable to climate change is struggling with soaring property insurance Rents for Ross’ West Palm office towers remain some of the highest in the country because of the dearth of highend supply Without the social infrastructure in place to attract highfinance firms it may be hard to fill those buildings too Brian Carr cofounder and managing partner at HighBrook Investors opened an office at Ross’  Rosemary after living in Florida during Covid lockdowns “It made a lot of sense from a business standpoint” he says Carr says the building is full most days but the West Palm migration frenzy has faded “The people that had moved down there due to Covid are already there and I don’t see more people moving down now” he says “It’s not as affordable as it used to be and there are other more appealing places in the Southeast that theyre moving to now” Ross has been spearheading efforts to develop more amenities that appeal to affluent newcomers Throughout the area golf clubs nearby were full so the billionaire made his first foray into the business by building a private threechampionshipcourse club in Hobe Sound just off Interstate  by Jupiter Island He’s exploring options for hospitals including bringing a Cleveland Clinic to the area according to a person familiar with the matter Space is limited at schools such as Palm Beach Day Academy where the highest tuition approaches  a year and there are few other options for Northeasterners used to an array of elite institutions Related and Frisbie Group a local developer have hired staff to better understand the business of education but it’s been a challenging process even with a slew of wealthy donors willing to provide generous gifts to make the deals happen Pine Crest a top private school with campuses in Boca Raton and Fort Lauderdale was exploring a West Palm location but isn’t currently moving forward a person with knowledge of the situation said “This stuff is incredibly complicated and difficult to get to the finish line” says Cody Crowell a partner at Frisbie Group who’s also working with Ross on the Vanderbilt effort “We have great sites but we don’t have great schools yet” Still he points to West Palm Beach’s small size as an advantage for young professionals such as himself “In other places in the country you don’t have access and ability to coordinate and collaborate with individuals such as Steve Ross” he says Ross has been helped by a welcoming West Palm Beach government that’s a contrast to the more closedoff Palm Beach which is closely guarded by its entrenched elite Andrew Dance who’s developing an office building in West Palm and previously worked at Related for  years says Ross understands how to work with local officials to get things done quickly “We’re very lucky to have developers and folks who are investing in our city and our community on a larger level” says Christina Lambert a city commissioner Still she pointed to needs such as more affordable housing calling the current supply “a drop in the bucket” Bringing in a university would be one of the most complex negotiations yet While Palm Beach County has boomed the knock on the area has been that it doesn’t have a Stanford or Harvard nearby to create a homegrown pipeline of highly educated workers The Vanderbilt plan calls for the school to build mainly on vacant public land controlled by the city and county where the University of Florida already tried and failed to develop a campus Crowell an alumnus says he approached Ross with the idea of bringing his alma mater to West Palm instead Ross’ private event this month featured Vanderbilt Chancellor Daniel Diermeier who was in town meeting with city officials and potential donors Supporters have committed nearly a third of the fundraising goal of at least  million contingent on certain conditions such as securing the land Crowell says more fundraisers are planned this summer in places such as Nantucket Aspen and the Hamptons areas flush with the kinds of power players who can feed into Ross’ dreams of building a Wall Street South “The time is ripe to be doing something” Ross says “And you know I can’t help myself” To contact the author of this story Natalie Wong in New York at

"DOL Critics, Supporters Sound Off on Final Fiduciary Rule",https://www.wealthmanagement.com/regulation-compliance/dol-critics-supporters-sound-final-fiduciary-rule,"Wed, 24 Apr 2024 19:19:00 +0000","Advocates say RIAs have little to worry about, yet one opponent accused the DOL of waging an “ideological crusade” and said he’d recommend litigation to his board.",www.wealthmanagement.com,Following yesterday’s release of the final version of the Department of Labor’s new fiduciary rule critics and advocates are poring over the page text for changes from last falls proposed rule One securities attorney sought to assure those advisors working with retail investors that little would change for them as they’ve long fallen under previous rules’ standards Some found a change from the proposal clarifying that roboadvice should be treated as any other financial advice while one longtime critic argued the DOL was waging an “ideological crusade” and that he would advise his board to take the department to court The DOL’s final rule will go into effect on Sept  Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said the regulations would protect retirement savers from “improper investment recommendations and harmful conflicts of interest” President Joe Biden unveiled the proposed rule last October as part of his administration’s larger fight against socalled “junk fees” in numerous industries The DOL ran a day comment period along with a twoday public hearing held remotely in December This rule follows previous administrations’ attempts at their own fiduciary rules including a version by the Trump administration that was dead on arrival in the Biden White House and an Obamaera version vacated in  by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Little Change for RIAs Under current law advice providers are judged against a fivepart test to determine whether they’re investment advisor fiduciaries under ERISA mandates However most investment advisors offering advice to retail clients on an ongoing basis for compensation have historically met that test according to Max Schatzow a cofounder of RIA Lawyers The new rule likely won’t impact these advisors “They were probably already investment advice fiduciaries” he said “The type of people the old rule did not apply to was a lot of brokerdealers and insurance agents who basically took the position that their advice didn’t meet the fivepart test for one reason or another” The Labor Department’s jurisdiction extends only to retirement income security with no separate federal rule concerning insurance agents or even brokersdealers and their standard of conduct beyond Regulation Best Interest Therefore if something falls outside the scope of Reg BI it could fall outside the scope of federal regulation altogether before now Schatzow said Trade Groups Threaten Litigation However Marc Cadin the CEO of the financial services professional trade group Finseca told WealthManagementcom the rule stemmed from a “deeply flawed” process while the DOL had made some “cosmetic changes” from the proposal the root issues remained “This is an ideological crusade by the DOL they’re not interested in getting it right” he said “They believe they know what’s right and they’re going to impose it on the industry and ultimately on the American people” Finseca along with the Financial Services Institute the US Chamber of Commerce and others have criticized the DOL rule and the rulemaking process since the proposal was released Cadin testified before a US House Capital Markets Subcommittee hearing in January and met with the DOL and White House Office of Management and Budget on numerous occasions in the runup to the proposal and the final rule He also testified during the DOL’s twoday public hearing in December Cadin said he didn’t receive one question or comment in these meetings or hearings which he felt signaled the DOL’s disinterest in hearing from those he represented “We’ve got realworld expertise based on the work that financial security professionals do every day” he said “You don’t have a single question That’s outrageous” Cadin believes the new rule arrived in a different regulatory world than the  Obama rule In the interim the SEC passed the Regulation Best Interest rule and the National Association of Insurance Commissioner created a model rule for annuity protections adopted in more than  states What Changed From Last Fall’s Proposal Supporters including the CFP Board the AARP and the Consumer Federation of America CFA celebrated the final rule arguing it would “close legal loopholes that allowed some advisors to recommend investments with excessive fees and unnecessary risks” as AARP EVP and Chief Advocacy  Engagement Officer Nancy LeaMond said CFA Director of Investor Protection Micah Hauptman flagged differences between the proposal and the final rule that might make it more palatable to its critics including changes addressing concerns about “overbreadth” Those changes included clarifying that fiduciary status is an objective standard and that such a status would occur when the client and provider “reasonably understand” that the investor would rely on the recommendation for investment decisions In the proposal the DOL intended to use how advisors market and title themselves in deciding whether to assign fiduciary status but the final rule clarified that the titles credentials and marketing slogans would be “a relevant consideration but will not generally be determinative” for the DOL According to Hauptman the final rule also included a paragraph confirming that sales pitches and investment education can occur without ERISA fiduciary status being attached Advisors use the Prohibited Transaction Exemption PTE  to benefit from compensation if they put clients’ best interests first According to Hauptman the proposal excluded roboadvice generated via an interactive website from this opportunity but the final rule removed this exclusion The proposal also required disclosure on websites as a condition for the exemption but the final rule removed this with the disclosure requirements now “more consistent” with Reg BI he said Hauptman’s reading largely echoed the Investment Adviser Association IAA which supported the rule and was pleased by some changes including how the DOL lightened “the documentation burden for some rollover recommendations” and that roboadvice would be treated as other financial advice according to IAA General Counsel Gail Bernstein But Hauptman acknowledged litigation was likely the next front in the skirmish “We expect industry opponents who don’t want to or aren’t capable of competing for customers based on the cost and quality of their services will try to defeat these landmark rules in both Congress and the courts as they did the last time the DOL attempted to strengthen protections for retirement savers” he said “This time however the industry opponents’ efforts will not be successful” What’s next Financial Services Institute FSI CEO Dale Brown said in January that the group would likely sue the DOL to vacate the rule if it did not withdraw or “substantially” improve the rule the FSI wouldn’t comment on future moves as of yesterday with a spokesperson saying they were continuing to analyze the final rule Cadin said Finseca is in a coalition with likeminded groups including the American Council of Life Insurers ACLI the Insured Retirement Institute IRI and the North American of Insurance and Financial Advisors NAIFA The coalition won’t take any legal steps until each group’s board weighs its options and votes “I can’t speak to what other organizations will do because everyone will go through their own process What I can tell you is what I’m going to recommend as the CEO of Finseca to the board based on our analysis” Cadin said “And that is that we should litigate

the Democratic side” she added HR  has support from both parties “but there simply aren’t many windows for passing tax legislation in the current closely divided Congress” agreed John Lettieri CEO of Economic Innovation Group EIG a bipartisan public policy organization focused on the US economy Lettieri pointed to similar gridlock emerging over child tax credit legislation “At worst I anticipate that Opportunity Zones will be a significant part of the discussion next year as tax policy returns to the forefront thanks to the expiration of major provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” he wrote in an email Will investors care Deferrals on capital gains taxes are crucial for investors considering putting their money in Opportunity Zone funds and for the program to achieve its aim of helping underserved communities say industry insiders Given how long it took after the passage of the TCJA to clarify Opportunity Zone provisions and educate investors on its benefits the program still hasn’t realized its full potential according to Kelly Ann Winget CEO of Alternative Wealth Partners LLC an emerging private equity manager Funds run by Alternative Wealth Partners have investments in projects located in Opportunity Zones including manufacturing energy and infrastructure businesses So far individual investors have primarily used the Opportunity Zone program to mitigate taxes on their capital gains when they couldn’t do  exchanges which are more limited Winget noted But today more private equity and venture capital players are considering the program because it would allow them to pursue longterm returns through a taxfree vehicle “I think it’s important that the program keeps going because there was a lot of wasted time in the first five years of the program” said Winget “We’ll start seeing the results of the people who initially invested using this strategy back in  in the next couple of years as those capital gain taxfree exits start in  I think that not enough people knew all the right information there is still not a lot of clarity around how the program works or the incentives that can be stacked on top of each other” Winget added that investors could reap outsized returns if they put their money into Opportunity Zones over the next five years provided Congress extends the program A  working paper by the US Office of Tax Analysis found that for the tax year  individual investors accounted for approximately  or  electronically filed reports for qualified investment in Qualified Opportunity Zones The office also determined that the median individual investor in a Qualified Opportunity Fund had an adjusted gross income of roughly  The average amount invested in these funds was around  million with the median deferred gain of approximately  Professional services firm Novogradac  Company LLC reported that from the inception of the Opportunity Zone program through yearend  Qualified Opportunity Funds raised at least  billion In  Qualified Opportunity Funds tracked by Novogradac reported that their fundraising raised  billion in equity for  funds Most of the funds tracked by the firm  raised less than  million which indicates that they focused on one specific project rather than multiple deals Novogradac researchers noted One real estate investment firm that focuses on raising money for such singleasset Opportunity Zone funds is Richmond Vabased Capital Square The RIAs the firm works with appreciate the ability to perform due diligence on specific deals in the singleasset funds and see what they are allocating money to according to Adam Stifel chief development officer The company has raised approximately  million from retail investors for eight singleasset funds Most of the assets involve multifamily development It took a while for investors to get educated on how Opportunity Zones work Stifel said However “It’s now almost become a household word in the tax world like  is and the program needs the time to take advantage of that I think most people understand the basics of what an Opportunity Zone is at this point and the interest level is really high on the retail side” He noted that Opportunity Zone investments’ tax advantages are a significant selling point So far Capital Square has completed the projects in its Opportunity Zone funds stabilized them and refinanced them before the program’s  sunset on capital gains deferral If the program expires less than two years from now Capital Square could still raise equity from institutional investors and other types of LPs Still the interest from individual investors would likely dampen according to Stifel “It’s hard to overstate how important that year benefit is” he said “There could be slowing and less interest from our investor base if we are no longer able to achieve a refinance distribution before our investors’ original capital gain tax is due” Both Stifel and Winget believe the extension bill will eventually be adapted Since Congress enacted the program during the Trump administration if he wins a second term there would be little reason for him to undo his legacy by dismantling the program Winget noted Likewise if Biden wins in November the Democratic party will want to keep investment flowing to underserved areas she said Coverman is more cautious about how things might play out She noted that Congress will likely be more concerned about expenditures next year than in  That means supporters of the Opportunity Zone program must show that its benefits would outweigh the negative budget score the extension of its tax breaks would receive “It’s going to be important to keep this policy supported on a bipartisan basis but that will be done by showing policymakers the program’s positive impacts” she said “We are early on in what I think is going to be a very big and nuanced conversation next year”
"REIT Fundamentals Remain Positive, But Signs of Softening Emerge",https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/reit-fundamentals-remain-positive-signs-softening-emerge,"Mon, 08 Apr 2024

FFO in  according to Nareit’s TTracker While positive it was much lower than the figures posted in  and  when FFO grew  and  respectively The story was similar for net operating income NOI with  growth down from  and  the two prior years Related Half of US Households Own REIT Stocks Meanwhile the FTSE Nareit All Equity index posted total return growth of  in March bringing the index closer to positive territory for the year Yeartodate the index is down  after total returns grew  in  Nareit also posted an update on how the  largest actively managed real estate investment funds focused on REITs are adjusting their allocation strategies Related Fund Managers are Bullish on REITs in  WealthManagementcom spoke with Edward F Pierzak Nareit senior vice president of research and Nicole Furnari Nareit vice president of research about the TTracker fund research and March’s results This interview has been edited for style length and clarity WealthManagementcom Let’s start with the TTracker What did we learn from the fullyear results from REITs Ed Pierzak We still have good numbers in terms of operational performance including FFO growth and NOI growth in the last quarter of  All of that remained positive One of the things we are starting to see when you look at quartertoquarter rather than yeartoyear is that we’re seeing more negative numbers It could be seasonality in the data but it could also be a softening in operations If you look at the strength of the growth we’ve had over the last five or six months we see this tapering in the strength It shouldn’t be much of a surprise By supply and demand measures there is some softness there We’re starting to see demand taper off in some sectors That said when we look at occupancy rates we find they continue to be very strong for all property types excluding office If you look at those rates for apartments retail and industrial they average between  and  These are solid numbers For office we have seen a decline but also seen it leveling out The office occupancy rate is  which is the same as the previous quarter I would view that as good news as well Broadly speaking if we take the TTracker and compare it with CoStar’s numbers which would be a broader indication of the market we find the TTracker occupancy rates are similar to but higher than the CoStar numbers So operationally I think we are in pretty good shape WM So when you are talking about a softening what does that entail EP Samestore NOI grew at  But in the previous quarter it was  and in the quarter prior to that it was  It’s a tapering of growth And likewise if you look at FFO the growth levels are also lower We’re talking about this tapering on a yearoveryear basis If you look into some of the sectors industrial yearoveryear is negative but if you think about it industrial had been so strong for so long that some moderation was inevitable WM Another part of TTracker gauges the health of REIT balance sheets What are you seeing there EP They look really good In terms of leverage ratio we’re at  This is a level that I would say is akin to a core investment strategy in the private world In this higher interest rate environment REITs have done the right things Their weighted maturity is  years and average rates are  Compositionally over  of REIT debt is fixedrate debt and nearly  of it is unsecured debt Unsecured debt proves to be a competitive advantage not only in accessing debt but accessing it at an attractive rate WM And this is something we’ve been talking about periodically in our conversations It seems like balance sheets are largely holding up over time EP We’ve seen the numbers change on the margins but REITs have been well disciplined and put this strategy in place of longerterm debt fixedrate and unsecured and carried it out for the long term They have a longer horizon focus rather than a shortterm one WM Pivoting to the monthly and yeartodate returns what stands out there for you EP We just finished up the first quarter and REITs were down modestly The All Equity index was down a little over  As you look across the sectors in the broadest sense most have done OK Those up were specialty REITs data centers and lodging With the monthly numbers we ended March up a little shy of  One of the things to look at across there is the strength of office up  As much as we hear about office woes there is a recognition that there is still upside in that sector WM What stands out in the research you’re doing in gauging the activity of the largest active managers First off can you remind me of the methodology of who you’re looking at Nicole Furnari It’s based on Morningstar data and it’s the  largest It is largely mutual funds and ETFs The big standout for the fourth quarter was a shift to near parity to what their index would be In comparing the funds with the FTSE index for example telecommunications was very underweight when we started looking With yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter growth that underweight level has shrunk and gotten close to zero It’s also true of gaming and specialty REITs Specialty REITs posted the largest yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter gains Active managers are pushing into some of these newer property sectors WM In looking at some of the charts in your piece residential stands out in terms of managed funds being overweight relative to the allequity index NF Funds really love residential And historically they have been overweight What’s interesting is if you look at the trend over time they are easing off the accelerator and shifting allocations It’s worth pointing out there’s also been an uptick on the retail side We’re seeing gains in retail and some funds shifting to that sector It seems like they have a positive outlook on people shopping in stores EP With retail demand is really outstripping supply For years we had heard in the press that the US was overretailed but retail supply was curtailed and developers stopped that supply for a number of years So it’s not so much that demand has gone through the roof it’s that it has exceeded supply growth WM We’ve also seen a lot of lowerquality retail properties get removed as well correct Some of that has been converted or shut down so now things are more in balance Correct NF There’s been a flight to quality yes You’ve also seen directtoconsumer brands like Warby Parker move to build out physical stores WM Right more retailers are taking omnichannel approaches NF Yes WM Are there lessons for other investors based on what the actively managed funds are doing NF Everyone can take from this what speaks to them We are providing the information as a way of saying here’s where the active managers are putting their money When I started this project I was concerned there would not be much to say quartertoquarter But every quarter a narrative has come out of it It’s been something interesting to see

Q&amp;A: Hines Private Wealth Solutions&#039; Paul Ferraro,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/qa-hines-private-wealth-solutions-paul-ferraro,"Fri, 05 Apr 2024 18:58:00 +0000","Historically, the real estate investment manager relied on independent broker/dealers to reach private wealth. It wants to diversify both its distribution and its investment offerings.",www.wealthmanagement.com,Earlier this month global real estate investment manager Hines launched the Hines Private Wealth Solutions platform Since the firm has been offering real estate investment opportunities to private wealth investors for the past  years raising close to  billion by the end of  the move was more of a rebranding than a launch according to Paul Ferraro who joined Hines from The Carlyle Group two months ago to lead the effort The firm whose offerings in the private wealth space include nontraded REITs and a real estate exchange has relied largely on independent brokerdealers to reach highnetworth investors in the past Ferraro’s task will be to duplicate what he did at Carlyle—develop Hines’ relationships with RIAs and family offices as well as with wirehouses launch new semiliquid funds and expand the business in Europe and Asia Related Asset Manager Hines Launches Private Wealth Solutions WealthManagementcom recently talked to Ferraro about his new role and what we should expect to see from Hines Private Wealth Solutions as it grows This QA has been edited for length style and clarity Related Hines Looks to Wealth Managers for New “Recovery Fund” WealthManagementcom Hines has already worked in the private wealth channel for the past two decades What was the impetus to create Private Wealth Solutions right now Paul Ferraro The Hines Private Wealth Solutions platform builds on the momentum of the firm’s year history that you spoke of We are calling it a rebranding rather than a launch In my opinion it is part of a natural evolution of the business It really reflects on commitment to offering quality products to a variety of investors both in the US and around the world Like our peers we see the enormous potential in the private wealth channel What’s different about Hines is we believe our position as a real estate leader with global footprint and  years experience makes us uniquely qualified to develop manage and operate real estate assets in what is turning out to be an everchanging environment My job is to capitalize on the expected growth of private wealth in broadening and deepening our relationships across distribution channels expanding in Europe and Asia and providing investment opportunities across the riskreturn spectrum designed to meet the goals of our clients WM Has Hines set any goals in terms of how much it would like to grow fundraising from the private wealth channel PF We don’t publicly state goals like that What we are trying to do though is build a platform that’s diversified across distribution channels both here in the US and across the globe so I think you can probably read into that that the financial goals are aggressive as they should be WM You headed private wealth at the Carlyle Group before you came to Hines What were some of the biggest takeaways from your role there about how to grow distribution channels for Hines PF At Carlyle I was employee No  for Carlyle Private Wealth I was brought in from Morgan Stanley to really to build the business And if you fastforward a decade plus that I was there we had distribution businesses that were covering wirehouses and independent brokerdealers an RIA and family office team teams in Europe Asia and Canada and we had amassed about  billion of commitments over that time During that period we also created four evergreen semiliquid offerings covering both credit and equity in the US Europe and Asia There is only really a handful of people in the industry who built similar businesses My plan is to use that playbook on how to do it successfully and execute it here at Hines WM How does the firm currently get its products that are available for individual investors in front of advisors PF The firm historically has really focused heavily on one particular private wealth channel And what I’ve been asked to do is to expand that business significantly through new client forums RIAs and then multi and singlefamily offices To get our products in front of these clients No  we need to build the infrastructure necessary to do so and that’s happening right now That will allow us to launch new products that cater to the way RIAs and financial advisors consume them today We are also looking to efficiently deliver our direct deal content—not just funds—directly to RIAs and wealth management partners and family offices That’s the first two things—to create the delivery systems necessary but it’s also coming up with the right strategies and return profile and risk tolerance for those markets WM You said the firm was heavily focused on one particular private wealth channel What was it PF It would have been the independent brokerdealer channel WM You just mentioned and the press release announcing Hines Private Wealth Solutions also mentioned deepening the distribution channels How are you planning to build out those delivery systems PF Again it’s a function of three things It’s the infrastructure internally that we need which we are building and that’s a work in progress But it’s also about partnering with certain platforms that RIAs and wealth managers like to use We are doing that now we are building those relationships and that will allow us to deliver these products to RIAs and financial advisors the way that they want to consume them WM Are you talking about alternative investment platforms like CAIS iCapital and Yieldstreet PF iCapital and CAIS are the two that we have built relationships with and are growing yes WM Have the products that Hines offered in the past or is offering right now been available to retail investors Or have they been mostly focused on accredited investors PF At Hines the products have specifically in the past been designed for highnetworth individuals and typically highnetworth individuals that were working through some thirdparty wealth manager That would be focused on a nontraded REIT for example or a real estate exchange program Those are two big products we have today in the market But we are looking to expand that to potentially adding things like real estate credit strategies and also direct deals where we are bringing direct Hines deal flow to investors through their wealth manager partners I would say the way the industry is moving the way that financial advisors are investing in private market strategies today tends to be through openended semiliquid offerings For us any new products we bring out we are going to want to structure them in a way that meets the needs of most of our financial advisors and RIAs WM It sounds like Hines would like to offer more types of evergreen investment vehicles to the market Do you have a sense of what types of products you might be looking at PF That is absolutely accurate I would say it’s expanding our product lineup from what we have today which is focused on income and capital appreciation to the more real estate credit strategies that may also focus on income and capital appreciation but do it in a different way than an equity strategy would WM Focusing on real estate specifically as an investment choice the past two years have been tough The perception of what was going on in the commercial real estate market vs reality may not have matched for many people who were outside of that industry Do you have a sense of how advisors feel about allocating money to real estate right now PF Let me start with acknowledging that it has been a tough market for real estate assets for the past two years And I think financial advisors are still reticent to jump back in with both feet What I would say to them is our data shows that the real estate industry runs in long cycles That’s typically  to  years The typical downturn lasts  months on average Where are we today The real estate correction began about two years ago when the Fed started raising interest rates We are two years into that cycle and that should mean we are towards the end of it in our view When you look at the data we believe we are seeing the signals of the beginning of a new long cycle of growth If this is a multiyear recovery like we expect I think investors could see rising income from distributions they could see more stability in valuations and capital appreciation Our hope is that investors are seeing the same opportunity we do because these windows do eventually close and the opportunity won’t be there forever WM Does Hines currently have any education initiatives for advisors to get them up to speed on what real estate investment can offer and how the different vehicles that Hines employs work PF The first place I would point people to is our website The Hines Private Wealth Solutions website has a lot of good information on and about real estate and investing in private real estate We also do a lot of individual and client seminars for financial advisors talking to their clients about real estate without talking about a specific product It’s really an educational opportunity for them We are going to continue to build on it And on top of that we have a talented veteran sales team that is out there in the market These are people who have been with us for  years in many cases so they are not new to this industry they’ve been through multiple cycles They can speak very intelligently about them WM Is there anything else you feel it’s important for our audience to know about Hines Private Wealth Solutions PF As we build the brand inside the private wealth space I’d like them to know who we are which is a real estate investment manager that develops operates and owns assets We have a strong diversified track record that dates back over  years And private wealth is not new to us We have a year history within the private wealth industry And depending on the financial advisor’s or RIA’s return profile and the risk tolerance they are seeking we should have a solution for them

Constructing a More Efficient Investment Portfolio with Alternatives,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/constructing-more-efficient-investment-portfolio-alternatives,"Mon, 25 Mar 2024 13:28:00 +0000",Adding private real estate boosts returns and quells volatility.,www.wealthmanagement.com,For many years advisors have relied upon a conventional  stockbond mix for client portfolios Stocks would provide the desired growth while hopefully protecting against inflation and bonds would generate income and a hedge against stock declines or recessions ’s historic decline in the  mix brought to reality what was already a growing concern the conventional  isn’t working for many clients it likely won’t work well in the future and more effective allocations are now more widely available to individual investors More efficient portfolios with an alternatives allocation generate higher total returns and do so with lower volatility and drawdown while also exhibiting lower correlations to the other asset classes within the portfolio The Correlation Challenge Related One Asset Managers Approach to Courting Individual Investors and Advisors The year Treasury’s recent positive correlation to stocks limits the effectiveness of portfolios principally comprised of equities and fixed income Rolling correlation between the year UST and equities SP  has increased in the last several years Although ’s dismal performance is behind us the higher and positive correlation between equities and fixed income that commenced in  has persisted through August  The RiskAdjusted Return Challenge Related QA Looming Regulation Could Impact the Use of Alternative Investments Finding attractive longterm returns may also be a challenge for today’s investors as portfolios have grown more complex and riskier as measured by standard deviation Research from Callan Associates indicates that  years ago  nominal returns could be generated with cash and fixedincome securities whereas in  a hodgepodge of six different asset classes would be needed including equity across all market caps international equity exposure private equity and real estate—with more than  times the volatility Therefore more than ever investors must seek allocations to asset classes that can generate meaningful returns that are effective diversifiers to equities and that have low volatility Although challenging certain alternative investments meet these criteria Private Real Estate An Efficient Portfolio Diversifier Private real estate exhibits attractive characteristics that can help diversify in today’s markets The asset class has generated  annualized return in the last  years since the NCREIF Property Index’s inception Importantly it has generated these returns with  annualized volatility a figure that is more comparable to investment grade bonds than to listed real estate and stocks However unlike fixed income private real estate has the potential for capital appreciation a critical component in today’s modestly higher inflationary environment Additionally two of the most important characteristics of real estate are the low correlation to and lower drawdown compared to publicly traded equities The NPI has experienced a  correlation to public equities since the NPI inception Correlation over time has been fairly consistent the trailing figures are   and  for the trailing  year  year and  year respectively Drawdown a particularly painful component for individual investors was also considerably lower in private real estate with a maximum drawdown of  vs  for the SP  Adding Alternatives May Benefit Investors Regardless of Their Investment Profile Alternatives serve a unique purpose in investors’ portfolios through their absolute returngenerating ability they can increase a total portfolio’s returns They can also offer significant diversification benefits through the lower correlation and lower volatility characteristics that alternatives have relative to public equities Analysis from JP Morgan Asset Management shows alternatives’ benefits for a variety of risk appetites and that an allocation to alternatives has increased both the total annualized returns while also reducing the volatility over  years with a variety of allocation amounts Alternatives Play a Crucial Role in Investors’ Portfolios Because correlation and volatility have recently increased in the equity and fixed income markets adding asset class alternatives such as private real estate and alternative credit to a traditional  portfolio may be beneficial In the trailing  years reallocating  of a  portfolio into private real estate would have increased return and reduced volatility thus investors may be better able to generate higher portfolio riskadjusted returns by allocating a portion of their portfolios to such alternatives A  Alternatives Allocation Was Best Taken from Bonds in the Last  Years in the Future it Might be Best Reallocated from Equities A  stockbondprivate real estate portfolio would have generated higher returns with lower volatility in the last  years reflective of a bond market that underperformed in an ultralowrate environment Stocks benefitted from this environment but moving forward a higher interest rate world is likely to challenge stocks in favor of credit investments Thus while a  allocation to alternatives may have been best reallocated from fixed income in the past given the facts on the ground a  or  stockbondalternative are more efficient portfolio allocation models in the future

to their completeness or accuracy What Are the Risks All investments involve risks including possible loss of principal The value of investments can go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested Investments in many alternative investment strategies are complex and speculative entail significant risk and should not be considered a complete investment program Depending on the product invested in an investment in alternative strategies may provide for only limited liquidity and is suitable only for persons who can afford to lose the entire amount of their investment An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges and involves incremental risks as opposed to investments in public companies such as dealing with the lack of available information about these companies as well as their general lack of liquidity Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss Risks of investing in real estate investments include but are not limited to fluctuations in lease occupancy rates and operating expenses variations in rental schedules which in turn may be adversely affected by local state national or international economic conditions Such conditions may be impacted by the supply and demand for real estate properties zoning laws rent control laws real property taxes the availability and costs of financing and environmental laws Furthermore investments in real estate are also impacted by market disruptions caused by regional concerns political upheaval sovereign debt crises and uninsured losses generally from catastrophic events such as earthquakes floods and wars Investments in real estate related securities such as assetbacked or mortgagebacked securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks An investment in private securities such as private equity or private credit or vehicles which invest in them should be viewed as illiquid and may require a longterm commitment with no certainty of return The value of and return on such investments will vary due to among other things changes in market rates of interest general economic conditions economic conditions in particular industries the condition of financial markets and the financial condition of the issuers of the investments There also can be no assurance that companies will list their

Why Some Investors Are Bullish on Private Real Estate,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/why-some-investors-are-bullish-private-real-estate,"Wed, 14 Feb 2024 15:20:00 +0000",Valuations in the private real estate market are finally starting to reflect higher interest rates and tighter debt availability.,www.wealthmanagement.com,Asset managers say the next two years might be the best time during this market cycle to dive into private real estate As clients display a growing appetite for outsized riskadjusted returns RIAs have been keeping an eye on opportunities for investment in private real estate For example Gary Quinzel vice president of portfolio consulting with Wealth Enhancement Group noted that his firm is looking at core real estate “It really is an interesting area that’s been out of favor and some might find it a little boring because it doesn’t offer yields in the teens” he said “But we like those areas of the market that produce very stable returns and have lower leverage They form a good core of the portfolio” Related Fund Managers are Bullish on REITs in  Christopher Burrows partner with Cerity Partners acknowledged that investing in real estate takes patience because the cycles tend to be slow The firm already invests in real estate debt but “can envision a world where we move toward opportunistic equity” Last year investors from the private wealth channel focused mostly on falling property valuations according to Julia Butler managing director in the real estate group of private equity firm KKR and chief investment officer with KKR Real Estate Select Trust Inc KREST an incomeoriented  Act REIT that targets both commercial real estate equity and debt In  KREST had to limit redemptions as investor requests exceeded quarterly limits Today institutional investors have already started increasing allocations to some of KKR’s closedend real estate funds Butler noted Individual investors have been slower to join in but in conversations they are more focused on identifying the right moment to jump back into the private real estate market rather than worrying about distress contagion she said Related Redemption Requests Raise Eyebrows for NonTraded REITs “They want to see performance really turn around before they start allocating more to the space So they tend to take longer to come back into the space than institutional investors But I do feel the sentiment is turning In fact when we meet with advisors and prospective investors they are all asking ‘Is now the time to invest in real estate’ They are trying to figure out if now is the bottom And that’s a shift certainly in terms of the questions we receive They anticipate that real estate is going to be an attractive opportunity set they are trying to bottomtick the market which is obviously very hard to do” Commercial real estate has generated a lot of negative headlines in the past two years but concerns of overall distress may be overblown The office sector faces the biggest challenges but represents only a fraction of the commercial real estate market Other property types including multifamily industrial and data centers have retained strong fundamental performance The biggest uncertainty has been the price gap between buyers and sellers in the face of higher interest rates which has turned into a drawnout process and suppressed deal volume During the decade ending in  US private real estate delivered annualized returns of  according to Bloomberg data cited by JLL Investors putting their money to work in core real estate in  and  might see IRRs in the  to  range said James Corl executive vice president and head of private real estate group with investment manager Cohen  Steers While many investors stayed away from private real estate in  because properties continued to be overvalued prices on certain segments of the private real estate universe have either bottomed out or are on their way to do so Corl noted The process should continue over the next two years with another  to  decline in values—and that’s the moment when investors will have the opportunity to realize the highest returns The most important thing in the space is stability” said Rick Schaupp a managing director with Clarion Partners which operates the Clarion Partners Real Estate Income Fund aimed at the wealth channel Its hard

I think with the Fed signaling that there are rate decreases coming Hopefully stability remains in the year Private real estate equity valuations have gone down Weve all experienced adjustments But I don’t think we need to see the Fed cut immediately We just need stability Were trying to make smart longterm investments Were not trying to time the market Research by Cohen  Steers shows closedend

of the cycle in the year immediately after the Fed stops tightening” Corl said “About a year or so plus or minus after that is when you want to be jumping into private real estate” Tough year Last year fundraising for private real estate investment took a hit as the sector faced higher interest rates worries about access to debt capital and stalled sales In the fourth quarter of  global real estate fundraising fell to its lowest level since the start of the pandemic with  funds totaling  billion according to Londonbased research firm Preqin Private real estate deal flow in North America fell  between the third and fourth quarters to  billion Among the private real estate vehicles are ones specifically geared toward the wealth channel including nontraded REITs  Act funds tender offer funds and interval funds that invest in real estate Compared to traditional private real estate placements investments in these vehicles have lower minimums no capital calls provide simplified tax reporting and feature some access to liquidity By November investors surveyed by Preqin sounded more optimistic about the performance of real estate assets over the coming year Only  of respondents expected performance to worsen over that period—down from  in November  A January note from Eaton Vance the asset management division of Morgan Stanley Investment Management stated that real estate assets had already “repriced meaningfully” over the previous two years Eaton Vance researchers wrote that returns on investment following such periods of price adjustment tend to exceed historical averages MSCI Real Assets a real estate data firm reported that in  its allproperty price index declined by  By yearend cap rates on sales of core property types were averaging  to  basis points higher than in  The only exceptions included the hotel sector where values stayed flat and seniors housing where cap rates contracted by  basis points The year also proved challenging for asset managers with private real estate vehicles KREST’s returns for  were down  Brookfield Real Estate Income Trust a nonlisted REIT that invests in debt and equity reported its first annual loss with total returns down  Returns for Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust BREIT another nonlisted REIT that targets the private wealth market fell  compared to a fiveyear return of  Starwood Real Estate Income Trust SREIT a perpetual life monthly NAV REIT saw an annual decline of  In December SREIT launched a  exchange program to sell up to  billion in beneficial interests in DSTs to accredited investors to shore up fundraising The company was planning to use the net proceeds to repay debt and repurchase shares among other things according to its SEC filing SREIT like KREST BREIT and others had to contend with investor redemption requests exceeding its limits in  “What happened in private real estate and specifically the nontraded REIT market because it’s a semiliquid product was that several investors were trying to get out as valuations were adjusting and these funds generally limit redemptions at up to  of NAV per quarter” Butler said “Five percent is pretty good flow for an illiquid asset class but at certain points in the market and still even to this day the demand to get out of some of these funds exceeded the limits on a quarterly basis” Buy at the Bottom However when Jon Gray Blackstone’s president and chief operating officer spoke at the company’s fourthquarter earnings call he noted that real estate values are bottoming out signaling a period of opportunity “While it will take time we can see the pillars of a real estate recovery coming into place” he said “We are of course not waiting for the allclear sign and believe the best investments are made during times of uncertainty” Cohen  Steers estimates that unlevered prices on commercial real estate have already fallen by about  from their previous cycle peak With the year Treasury reaching a year high and making borrower costs prohibitively expensive in the  range the market will likely see an increase in forced sellers in  as more real estate owners face loan maturities said Corl Data from the Mortgage Bankers Association and analytics platform CREDiQ shows that  trillion in commercial real estate loans will reach maturity over the next two years with  billion coming due in  Meanwhile MSCI Real Assets estimates that the volume of distress among commercial real estate properties in the US reached  billion by the end of  while the value of assets classified as “potentially troubled” totaled roughly  billion Some of that distress was tied to exorbitant prices investors paid for properties in the cheap credit environment immediately following the pandemic For example more than  of the multifamily properties added to the “potential distress” list in the fourth quarter were purchased in the last three years MSCI Real Assets noted “Over the course of the year we expect to see some of these maturities impact otherwise great real estate forcing more equity owners to sell their assets In addition certain assets are already trading at a material discount to replacement cost Given that we expect construction costs to remain high we believe this represents an attractive buying point for investors with a longerterm horizon since the shortage of supply from  onwards should provide landlords with real pricing power We are excited to buy some of these assets that we think are going to come to market” said Butler Cohen  Steers has already begun to see attractively priced acquisition opportunities in the private real estate market particularly in the shopping center sector where price correction is likely near the bottom because retail has been out of favor with investors longer than most other property types The property price index for retail declined by  yearoveryear by the end of  compared to a decline of  for industrial properties according to MSCI Real Assets But deal volume in the sector went up  in the fourth quarter compared to  more than for any other asset type In  and  it was commonplace for commercial real estate sales to close at cap rates in the  range according to Corl “We never believe that’s a good idea” he noted Today the firm is looking for and finding assets priced in the  to  range “We are very enthusiastic about the investment environment we are seeing right now” he said Similarly Butler noted that KREST has been getting more calls from sellers about potential acquisition opportunities though she added that investment sales activity is still below its normal pace She said that might be a function of people waiting for interest rates to stabilize before they start transacting Typically investment managers would advise their clients to expect returns of  to  from investment in core real estate through the private market Corl noted But he said those who get the timing right and invest right near the bottom of the market could reasonably expect returns of  to  The catch is that newly formed funds will likely benefit more from the price adjustment than existing funds that may be saddled with their own legacy issues Corl said that in many of the deals Cohen  Steers is looking at right now the sellers are core funds that must meet their redemption requests He noted that many of those funds bought assets at peak valuations two or three years ago and now have to sell at much higher cap rates “The more you read about headwinds and issues ranging from rising expenses to decreased credit availability the more it presents a buying opportunity” noted Marc Zahr copresident of Blue Owl Capital and head of the firm’s Real Estate platform “From our perspective and based on our strategy those problems can create a massive buying opportunity It allows groups that are wellfunded as we are and have a disciplined approach to investing and financing to potentially capture some of that market dislocation” Blue Owl Capital’s real estate vehicles which focus on singletenant net leased properties with investmentgrade tenants and longterm leases escaped many of the issues that plagued private real estate funds last year That was largely due to the company’s conservative investment criteria according to Zahr Blue Owl’s real estate funds including Blue Owl Real Estate Net Lease Trust ORENT only use fixedrate debt Zahr noted In addition the company’s entry point for new acquisitions tends to hover around  higher than the cap rates many of its peers have ended up transacting at over the past few years The firm’s joint venture with Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC to buy STORE Capital for  billion propelled it to the top of the most active real estate buyers’ list in  Inflows were six times higher than redemptions and its Blue Owl Real Estate Fund VI is on track to exceed its  billion cap “In spite of the very difficult backdrop for real estate fundraising our latest triple net lease fund was the single largest US real estate fund raised in ” said Marc Lipschulz cochief executive officer during the company’s earnings call on Feb  “We expect to exceed our hard cap of  billion more than doubling the size of the predecessor fund Furthermore our overall real estate platform performed admirably on both a relative and absolute basis returning  for the year”
Half of U.S. Households Own REIT Stocks,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/half-us-households-own-reit-stocks,"Fri, 09 Feb 2024 19:35:00 +0000","Through mutual funds, ETFs, target date funds and direct stock ownership, 168 million Americans have exposure to publicly traded REITs.",www.wealthmanagement.com,According to new research from Nareit the association representing publicly traded real estate companies  million Americans roughly  of all US households have some exposure to public REITs That ownership comes in direct stock ownership or through mutual funds ETFs or target date funds that include REITs Nareit generated that number by analyzing the Survey of Consumer Finances produced by the Federal Reserve According to Nareit “Direct holdings of stocks increased from  of households in  to  in  Most households’ equity investments are through taxdeferred retirement accounts that increased from  of households in  to  in ” Related Fund Managers are Bullish on REITs in  Other recent analyses from Nareit looked at the state of REIT balance sheets and provided an update on the valuation gap between private real estate and public REITs WealthManagementcom spoke with Edward F Pierzak Nareit senior vice president of research about the reports and January’s results Related REITs End  on a High Note Amid Favorable Interest Rate Outlook WealthManagementcom Let’s start with the findings on US household exposure to public REITs I have been thinking about this recently given how many mutual funds and ETFs include REITs and retirement plans What do you make of the number Ed Pierzak We have had a material increase in equities ownership If you go to  it was  and in  it’s up to  That’s one way exposure has increased The most significant benefit to REIT ownership is target date funds This shows that typical Americans are getting more exposure to commercial real estate and they are doing so through their traditional Ks mutual funds and target date funds which have become increasingly popular WM You recently wrote a piece updating the state of REIT balance sheets We have touched on this in the past with REITs generally sitting in a strong position in terms of rates fixed vs floating rates and long maturities Is that still holding up EP If we go to a broader picture and the performance we saw in January it’s an extension of that January numbers were disappointing in that REIT total returns were slightly negative with a loss of not quite  The Russell  had a narrow gain of about  The performance across sectors was consistently negative with the exception being data centers which were up  That’s no surprise given all the tailwinds they’ve had amid discussions of AI It’s a sector in which we’ve seen a lot of active REIT investment managers take overweight positions If we take a longer view and go from midOctober to the end of January REITs are still up  That’s a solid gain compared to a  gain for the Russell  So you can look at all that and say “What happened in January” The year started with the expectations of economists and financial markets that the Fed was going to go on a series of rate cuts throughout  Now we’ve gotten some indications that the rate cuts may be delayed Chairman Powell said effectively that he was downplaying the likelihood of a cut in March Then we got the report of  jobs created in January which was a surprise to the upside and better than economists had forecast The solid news is that the economy is performing well But that’s created a likelihood of a delay in any policy loosening So the thinking is that there could be a reaction to that in the January numbers for REITs even though history tells us that a higher rate environment does not equate to bad or negative performance for real estate which has performed well in low mid and high interest rate environments That takes us to latest piece which is to say that if we don’t see any rate cuts there’s no problem for REITs The weighted average cost of debt for REITs is still  It’s below the current year Treasury Over  of REIT debt is fixed rate and almost  is unsecured That should prove to be a competitive advantage The prospects for REITs are quite good and we think they will outperform private real estate WM That’s a nice segue into your other piece which was an update on the spread between public and private real estate valuations We’ve talked about the concept of those converging for a while Where are we in that process EP The delta between REIT implied cap rates and private real estate cap rates are still over  basis points If REIT cap rates came all the way down to private property valuations would have to increase by  That’s unlikely to happen But we think there will be a convergence through some gains in REIT performance and some writedowns on the private side Both sides will be active participants in the process WM In just thinking about the interest rate picture and inflation for that matter one factor here is that many leases are written with bumps tied to inflation correct So isn’t that a factor in why REITs can weather the current interest rate environment EP We are about  into quarterly earnings reporting to our TTracker We will have a fuller picture in a month but when we look at operational performance we find that REITs have been keeping pace with inflation with operational performance However the strength of the gains has been waning as inflation has been declining It is an intermingled story One of the things we mention is access to capital This is one of the positives It presents an opportunity for REITs for opportunistic acquisitions as they may come to the surface WM Is there any movement on that front Or is the market still frozen EP We are still in the price discovery process It’s working through In many ways the private market participants will have to come to that realization They will have to kick cap rates up a bit more before the transaction market returns to equilibrium

20:06:00 +0000","Historically, infrastructure had been prized for its “safety and stability.” Some asset managers claim now might be a good moment to get more exciting returns.",www.wealthmanagement.com,When global asset manager BlackRock announced it was buying infrastructure fund manager Global Infrastructure Partners for  billion earlier this month the news did not come as much of a shock BlackRock executives had been on the lookout for acquisitions in “growth sectors” and asset managers currently point to infrastructure as an attractive place for investors to put their money amid an uncertain market It tends to be less sensitive to high interest rates than other asset classes and since much of it provides necessary services it can be less volatile of an asset overall There are also opportunities to capitalize on growth areas of infrastructure right now including the transition to energy renewables and the increasing need for data transfer and storage Related A Look at CBRE Investment Management’s Push on Private Infrastructure But many financial advisors are just starting to take a closer look at infrastructure as an asset class “We believe infrastructure funds offer stable and steady cash flows with some diversification but our efforts to date have largely been focused on other portions of the alts universe” noted Nick Zamparelli senior vice president and chief investment officer with Sequoia Financial Group in an email “Infrastructure is an area of the alts spectrum we are looking to get more exposure to over time” Related Why Income Investors Should Consider Energy Infrastructure Previously other alternative investment options offered better riskadjusted returns while protection from inflation wasn’t as much of an issue Zamparelli noted Today the opportunities in infrastructure look more similar to those offered by real estate and private equity he added Gary Quinzel vice president portfolio consulting with Plymouth Minnbased RIA firm Wealth Enhancement Group said the firm’s advisors recommend some exposure to infrastructure when discussing allocations to real assets But those allocations tend to be lower than to other alternatives partly because infrastructure can be more easily impacted by external events like energy prices he noted WEG recommends around  of a clients alternative allocation go toward real assets and infrastructure It’s a different level of diversification but it’s very worthwhile to consider as part of a diversified portfolio” Quinzel said “We tend to approach it at times within our private bucket but we approach it in our liquid bucket as well” In general most WEG clients with under  million in assets have no allocation or under  to alternatives clients in the  to  million range may be closer to  in alternatives and clients with more than  million may have  in alternatives At the moment the wealth management community might lack the comfort level with infrastructure investments it has developed with private credit and real estate over the past decade according to Gregg Sommer partner and US financial intermediaries leader with Mercer Investments Once they get more education about the sector they will likely get more comfortable allocating to it he said “From a macroeconomic perspective there are a lot of infrastructure needs in America and across the globe” he said “If you have a macro pool that’s growing and then simultaneously education into an asset class that creates a nice match” What You Get With Infrastructure Investments Among infrastructure’s main attraction points is that it often comes with high barriers to entry and longterm contracts for providing essential services That translates into stable predictable cash flows and protection from inflation and interest rate volatility noted Chloe Berry managing director in the infrastructure group with alternative asset manager Brookfield and head of Brookfield Infrastructure Income Strategy a fund launched in  for the private wealth channel Infrastructure also tends to have high operating margins and largescale capital needs Given the uncertainty investors had to deal with over the past several years “we find them looking for that ‘sleep at night’ asset class that provides low volatility and protection and resiliency from what is an uncertain world out there” she said “And that is why investors are really excited about infrastructure right now” In the  months after Brookfield Oaktree Wealth Solutions launched Brookfield Infrastructure Income Fund it raised  billion Berry noted It’s a continuously offered unlisted closedend fund that first became available to individual investors in Europe and Asia Pacific and later to those in the US According to Londonbased research firm Preqin which regularly surveys institutional investors over  of them have been investing in infrastructure for diversification purposes Approximately  invest in the asset class as an inflation hedge and for a reliable income stream Forty percent prefer it because of its low correlation with other asset classes Return considerations tended to rank last However speaking at BlackRock’s fourth quarter earnings call on Jan  Chairman and CEO Larry Fink said infrastructure will be one of the fastest growing sectors of private markets for years to come Among the trends driving this growth Fink listed increasing global demand for digital infrastructure the need to upgrade logistical hubs and reconfigure existing supply chains and moves toward decarbonization and energy independence “Having a long duration high coupon inflationprotected asset is a very strong asset class for all the retirement funds but importantly wealth” he said “We believe it’s a great opportunity to provide to the wealth management market these types of products so they can enjoy these type of long duration assets” According to Bayo Ogunlesi founder and CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners the infrastructure fund manager who also spoke during the earnings call of  infrastructure companies in GIP’s flagship funds  reported doubledigit EBITDA growth in  “We believe of all the institutional caliber assets that you can add to your portfolio private infrastructure is the least correlated with the portfolios that most individual investors already have” said Bob Long partner and CEO with investment firm StepStone Private Wealth “In a world that’s experienced a tremendous amount of dislocation and uncertainty over the last handful of years it’s not surprising that the most sophisticated individual investors and their financial advisors are showing keen interest in infrastructure at this juncture” Last August StepStone Private Wealth launched StepStone Private

MapleBrown Abbott in the decade between December  and December  private infrastructure assets delivered returns of  Listed infrastructure assets delivered returns of  “Infrastructure tends to perform in a narrower band of returns” said Berry “Although we are seeing some really exciting opportunities arise because buyers have less access to capital right now When buyers are looking to buy infrastructure assets there are potentially less buyers out there and their ability to finance their acquisitions is harder right now With that backdrop we believe that for buyers like Brookfield that have access to capital there will be opportunities to buy at higher returns than we have seen for some time” The same applies to lending on private infrastructure she added New Funds Proliferate Last year fundraising for private infrastructure investment felt some of the same tailwinds as real estate and private equity—the denominator effect difficulty of accurately valuing assets in an environment with a slower deal flow and the popularity of private credit funds which could offer the same returns without the equity risk according to Preqin In  there were  funds raised targeting unlisted infrastructure totaling  billion compared to  funds totaling  billion in  However that trend is expected to reverse in  “Last year was a slow year—all private asset classes took a bit of a pause and a lot of that was rebalancing because of uncertainty in the listed markets” said Stephen Dowd chief investment officer private infrastructure strategies with real assets investment manager CBRE Investment Management “Now that traded markets have rebounded they are healthy you are going to see them getting back on track We expect this year infrastructure will continue that steady performance that we’ve seen through multiple cycles” At the same time there is a growing number of interval funds and other structures through which wealth managers can provide their clients with access to private infrastructure investment opportunities Dowd noted For example last March private equity giant KKR closed KKR Global Infrastructure Investors IV a  billion fund that was open to private wealth platforms family offices and highnetworth investors in addition to institutional players and sovereign wealth funds The fund’s focus is on critical infrastructure predominantly in OCED countries Just last week the fund agreed to acquire  wireless communication towers in Latin America However because of massive changes within some segments of infrastructure over the past decade investors and advisors need to be more careful about the riskreturn dynamics when it comes to infrastructure assets warned a  report from consulting firm McKinsey For example some energyrelated assets that had historically been viewed as “super core” might be riskier today as they are phased out by renewables At the same time some emerging segments of infrastructure might require outsized capital commitments to deliver targeted returns and come with periods of negative cash flow the report noted McKinsey found that between  and  average target IRRs on infrastructure investments declined by  to  a year In acknowledgement of the rapid evolution of the infrastructure market Brookfield expects to see the highest returns from a focus on the three “Ds” according to Berry—deglobalization decarbonization and digitalization Deglobalization encompasses investment in reconfigured supply chains as many critical industries are onshoring their manufacturing facilities after the disruption they experienced during the pandemic Decarbonization includes renewable power generation facilities as well as nuclear power battery storage EV charging stations and an amalgamation of other things that should help reduce carbon emissions “It’s really broad and requires an immense amount of capital” Berry said Digitalization also encompasses a wide universe of physical assets spanning from telecom towers to fiber optic networks As of yearend  Brookfield Infrastructure Income Fund held  assets valued at about  billion most of them focused on private infrastructure Almost half of its capital  was invested in renewable power and transition another  in utilities  in transportation and the rest was almost evenly divided between midstream energy and data Similarly CBRE Investment Management feels there are strong secular trends supporting growth in digital infrastructure and energy transition according to Dowd “There is a lot of infrastructure in those two categories” he noted “You can find data centers fiber networks local phone towers in digital infrastructure It’s a similar kind of thing in energy transition There is a movement toward solar wind and other types of renewables because they are now competitive or less expensive than other types of energy It’s a massive secular trend that we think is going to be there for a decade or decades” For StepStone and its STRUCTURE fund which is largely focused on investing in infrastructure through the secondaries market the way to limit risk is tied to diversification—across strategy vintage year geography and manager Long noted “We strongly feel that diversification is important to receive the best riskadjusted returns on infrastructure” he said That’s not a challenge when it comes to large institutional investors But for individual investors “particularly for a more niche strategy like infrastructure compared to say private equity it would be difficult for those investors to achieve manager diversification by making a series of commitments to proprietary funds” As of yearend  STRUCTURE had  million in assets under management It has focused on coreplus and valueadd investments Long also pointed to opportunities to buy performing infrastructure assets at discounts to fair value through secondary markets and achieve above trend returns that way He acknowledged discounts on infrastructure secondaries tend not to be as high as the ones on private equity offerings But over the last several quarters STRUCTURE has been able to take advantage of discounts that ranged from the high single digits to low double digits he said “History has shown the strongest vintages for private assets typically follow periods of dislocation and uncertainty” Long noted “We believe the near term is a very attractive entry point for the infrastructure asset class”
Edelman Presses Court to Let Suit Against Mariner Continue,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/news/edelman-presses-court-let-suit-against-mariner-continue,"Wed, 17 Jan 2024 17:02:00 +0000",Mariner asked a federal court to pause Edelman Financial Engines&#039; trade-secret lawsuit during an ongoing arbitration process. Edelman says that would only let Mariner continue raiding its advisors and clients &quot;with impunity.&quot;,www.wealthmanagement.com,Edelman Financial Engines is urging a Kansas federal court to deny Mariner Wealth Advisors’ request to pause Edelman’s lawsuit against it arguing that doing so would allow Mariner to “continue its unlawful conduct with impunity” In the original suit filed Nov  Edelman accused Mariner Wealth of enticing Edelman advisors to join their ranks stealing trade secrets and breaching confidentiality agreements and nonsolicitation clauses in the process Edelman argued Mariner was stealing “the fruits of Edelman’s multimillion dollar investments in marketing and client goodwill” Mariner fired back in December  accusing Edelman of a “nearly threeyear campaign to unlawfully stifle fair competition in the investment advisory services industry” and asked for the court to place a stay on the case while arbitration proceedings against some of the advisors who left Edelman for Mariner continue But the stay would “greatly prejudice Edelman” by allowing Mariner to continue poaching clients and trade secrets from Edelman while those arbitrations progressed which Edelman believes could last longer than the calendar year the company argued “As Mariner continues to solicit Edelman planners to divulge Edelman’s trade secrets and breach their Edelman agreements Edelman will be forced to choose between enforcing those agreements against breaching former employees potentially prolonging the stay Mariner seeks in this litigation and effectively waiving its right to enforce those agreements against breaching former employees so it can pursue this litigation against Mariner” the Edelman order read According to Edelman Mariner’s “calculated campaign” to hire away Edelman planners and get them to disclose proprietary client information began in the summer of  when Mariner poached Edelman advisor Michael Horne the move lost Edelman  clients and  million in assets the firm argued Edelman claims the total damage was the loss of ten advisors with  clients and  million over the past several years The firm says they became aware of Mariner’s alleged plot to target Edelman advisors and clients in  when that firm “significantly escalated its unlawful conduct” according to the order After pursuing arbitration against several of the advisors Edelman deduced Mariner was not going to stop its push and opted to sue the firm Among other things Mariner claimed that Horne and others provided a copy of his nonsolicitation agreement for Mariner and also allegedly recreated a client list for his new firm as well as contacting those clients and enticing them to follow him to Mariner But Mariner and Horne filed a suit against Edelman in  against Mariner arguing Edelman’s agreements with Horne were illegal under state law Eventually the case worked its way into arbitration where it is still pending In the latest suit Mariner argued that Edelman was already arbitrating against several of the former Edelman employees and said many of the issues in the new lawsuit were also being considered in the arbitrations “Mariner is sensitive to the undesirability in general of cases being dormant on the Court’s docket while related previously filed litigation is being pursued” Mariner’s motion read “Respectfully however that is a situation of Plaintiffs’ making They did not have to commence this case” But Edelman is arguing the arbitrations and federal lawsuit can and should proceed simultaneously Edelman noted that there are no pending arbitrations against five of the eight planners discussed in Mariner’s complaint and that this lawsuit is the only proceeding where Mariner is a party and being accused by Edelman “While the arbitrating Departed Planners have raised issues that will likely also be raised by Mariner here —for example whether Edelman’s restrictive covenant agreements are valid under the relevant law governing each individual agreement — the vast majority of claims issues and facts to be developed in discovery are simply not present in the pending arbitrations” Edelman claimed in its motion Neither company responded to a request for comment

Fund Managers are Bullish on REITs in 2024,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/alternative-investments/fund-managers-are-bullish-reits-2024,"Fri, 12 Jan 2024 18:19:00 +0000","With healthy property fundamentals and a favorable interest rate environment, REIT fund managers expect the sector to deliver double digit returns this year.",www.wealthmanagement.com,Publiclytraded REITs had a rough go of things during the Fed’s regime of rising interest rates Total returns on the FTSE Nareit All Equity index were down  in  and in negative territory for most of  But when the tenor on monetary policy changed REITs rebounded and ended  with the index up  REITs still trailed the broader equity market with the SP  up  The trend started to reverse in late  with the REITs posting a  return for the fourth quarter And it will likely continue in  as multiple factors converge to create a favorable environment for the sector according to REIT fund managers But as of Dec  publiclytraded equity REITs were trading at a median  discount to their consensus NAV per share according to SP Global Market Intelligence indicating further room for recovery Related REITs End  on a High Note Amid Favorable Interest Rate Outlook “It’s the interest rate stabilization piece it is the attractive valuation piece and it’s the fact that we will see growth in this sector especially in those sectors that are more defensively postured or have strong secular growth underpinning their demand” said Laurel Durkay managing director and head of global listed real estate assets with Morgan Stanley Investment Management As the global asset management firm Nuveen completed its investment outlook for  “the REIT sector was one of our top picks” noted Saira Malik chief investment officer with the firm Related Active Fund Managers Increased Allocations to Healthcare Residential and Data Center REITs Solid Fundamentals When it comes to portfolio fundamentals—occupancy levels rental income growth debt ratios—many publiclytraded REITs were already in a healthy place in  according to an outlook published last month by Steve Buller and Sam Ward real estate investment portfolio managers with Fidelity Yet all the news headlines about a “crisis in commercial real estate” driven largely by troubles in the office sector made investors nervous about putting their money into REITs “An issue with REITs has been in a sense that the baby has been thrown out with the bath water” said Malik “Many are worried about the office sector and so people feel ‘Why do I want to own anything associated with real estate public or private’ But if you look at REIT benchmarks the office sector tends to be less than  of benchmarks” When it comes to issues that might threaten the performance of US commercial real estate—which include concerns about liquidity a slow investment sales market the higher cost of capital and a potential recession—publiclytraded REIT shares already have those factors priced in noted Richard Hill senior vice president and head of real estate strategy and research with Cohen  Steers a global investment manager specializing in real assets “You now have a situation in which real estate securities are very attractively valued” said Durkay “REITs are screening cheap vs themselves and vs private real estate” That creates an attractive entry point for investors especially since public REITs tend to deliver their highest returns during early stages of the real estate recovery cycle said Hill—sometimes hitting above the  mark according to previous Cohen  Steers research In spite of REITs’ fourth quarter rally their total returns remain approximately  below previous peaks Hill noted Cohen  Steers estimates that if the Fed manages to achieve a soft landing for the US economy this year the sector will deliver returns in the  to  range AEW Capital Management forecasts total REIT returns of approximately  over the next two years which also roughly translates to low double digits in  according to Gina Szymanski managing director and portfolio manager real estate securities group for North America with the firm That’s based on a current dividend yield of  and growth of  The forecast will rise if the Fed ends up cutting interest rates later this year as it indicated it might during its December meeting Typically REITs deliver returns that are between those of a bond and an equity—somewhere in between  and  Szymanski noted “I would say we are on the higher end of what a REIT usually does for our outlook this year” she said “And then that would increase even more if we had a Fed pivot” Good Omens At the moment most of the investment managers WealthManagementcom spoke to consider the probability of an interest rate cut at the Fed’s March meeting to be low since the US economy continues to show resilience What they do anticipate is rate stabilization in the first half of the year followed by some moderate rate cuts later in —likely three or four of them as the Fed will attempt to keep real rates stable according to Malik Both rate pauses and rate cuts tend to create a favorable environment for publiclytraded REITs Szymanski noted Interest rate stability limits volatility of REIT valuations while lower cost of debt would allow REITs to take advantage of new acquisition opportunities at the same time as private market prices come down Hill estimates that private real estate valuations are about  of the way through to where they will ultimately end up That is how similar situations played out during the early s and in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis from  through  Hill noted Even a recession would not necessarily disrupt the positive outlook for publiclytraded REITs in his view In that scenario while REITs would deliver returns that would be close to  “we think they would outperform the SP  significantly on a relative basis” he noted In addition while a recession would put a dent in REITs’ property fundamentals it would also force the Fed to cut interest rates faster said Szymanski “So you kind of come right back to a positive outlook” Winners and Losers Of course the REIT industry has more than a dozen property subsectors and financial advisors should keep in mind that not all of them will do well even in a favorable environment Factors to consider include whether leasing and rental rates for the types of properties a REIT owns are likely to experience steady longterm growth and whether demand for these properties is currently outstripping supply Data center REITs for example seem to be on every investment manager’s recommendation list because growth in new technologies is likely to fuel greater demand for data centers for years At the same time issues with power availability previously limited the amount of new supply that could be added to that market That means REITs will not only have opportunities to grow their portfolios by adding new data centers going forward—they will be able to aggressively push rental rates for the first time “in a decade” noted Durkay Seniors housing REITs were another popular pick due to favorable demographic trends The youngest baby boomers are reaching an age when many people begin to move into seniors housing and the deliveries of supply to the sector had been significantly curtailed in the wake of the Covid pandemic In addition seniors housing has grown more upscale in recent years with “more activities more amenities It is making them more attractive for people at earlier ages” according to Malik REITs that own and operate singlefamily rentals SFR should benefit from a shortage of singlefamily homes for sale higher mortgage rates and the runup in prices for those homes Today buying a home is almost  more expensive than renting one Durkay noted which should drive demand for SFR units well past  A sector that is poised to benefit greatly from interest rate cuts are net lease REITs according to both Hill and Durkay Total returns within the sector tend to be highly negatively correlated with increases in interest rates Durkay noted Given that most net lease REIT portfolios tend to be almost fully occupied and rely on creditrated tenants interest rate cuts would allow for strong return growth going forward The nearterm outlook is less favorable for two sectors that have been investor favorites over the past few years—apartment and industrial REITs While both property sectors will continue to benefit from longterm demand drivers this year new supply deliveries are so far outpacing demand For the industrial sector in particular potential shortterm underperformance would have more to do with overly exuberant growth expectations than any propertylevel challenges according to Hill “If growth turns out to be really good just not great then we think the multiple can be pressured” he noted In addition in spite of their recent rally total returns were up  in December office REITs continue to flash warning signs to investment managers There is the issue of lingering vacancies and the fact that office utilization rates remain at roughly  of their prepandemic levels noted Durkay There is concern that the same advancements in technology that will prop up data centers will make remote work easier Plus office REITs might also run into problems with their loans as valuations in the sector drop “When you are looking at office demand I think it is going to be negative that will impair the overall level of occupancy it will impair the overall level of rents and what that ultimately does is impair the overall value of this real estate” said Durkay “When loans are coming due you will see in a lot of cases the value of the debt will be in excess of the value of the that property It is not only a demand problem a fundamentals problem I also believe it is a balance sheet and value problem So the outlook that I have for offices specifically in the US is not favorable over the long term”
Reliable Sources: How the NYT uncovered new info about Trump's wealth,http://money.cnn.com/2018/10/02/media/reliable-sources-10-02-18/index.html?section=money_media,"Tue, 02 Oct 2018 23:35:46 EDT",Read full story for latest details.,rss.cnn.com,New York CNN Business — A version of this article first appeared in the Reliable Sources newsletter You can sign up for free right here Trump’s  Susanne Craig says this investigation was without a doubt the hardest story she’s ever done “Imagine” she says “someone tossing a million white puzzle pieces into Times Square and being asked to put it back together” Those puzzle pieces were about the Trump family business Craig David Barstow and Russ Buettner pieced it all together for an extraordinary story published by the NYT on Tuesday afternoon It will fill eight special pages of the print edition on Wednesday Here’s the front page If you haven’t read it yet click here The Times also helpfully published a list of  takeaways from the investigation And here’s CNN’s story about it Now for the story behind the story NYT assistant managing editor Sam Dolnick called this “investigative reporter serendipity” Exactly two years ago on October   “the same NYT crew published a Trump taxes story after an anonymous source sent Susanne Craig  tax records” he tweeted Trump of course was elected without ever disclosing his taxes Flash forward five months In March  David Cay Johnston obtained a copy of Trump’s  returns Remember when he broke the story on Rachel Maddow’s show “That triggered our journey” Craig told me So it’s fair to say this was an month investigation The sourcing The trio obtained confidential tax returns Financial records Depositions And so on How I’ll leave that up to you to speculate “We had thousands of documents Hundreds of tax returns” Craig told me “Piecing all that together understanding what they did was beyond hard We triangulated documents Compared tax returns to financial statements and bank statements And then talked to sources on it Today we put it into one story all explained But it started with piles” of information sitting in the corner of the room A room with a locked door Buettner Barstow and Craig worked in a small room on the fourth floor of NYT HQ One of the only treats a bottle of Jameson on the shelf Most NYT reporters work from open cubicles But the trio needed privacy So the room was kept locked and they were the only ones with keys A multimedia rollout I mentioned the “takeaways” list earlier The NYT also had a video ready to go on Tuesday And the same documentary crew that made “The Fourth Estate” for Showtime also tagged along on this investigation Showtime will air the resulting “documentary short” titled “The Family Business Trump and Taxes” this Sunday at  pm ET It’s directed by Jenny Carchman produced by Liz Garbus and Justin Wilkes And it’s still in the works It’ll run approximately  minutes on Sunday Trumpworld’s threat Harder calls the story “highly defamatory” When the story dropped on Tuesday many journalists commented  in awe and envy  on the superconfident tone of the story The NYT reached what NPR’s David Folkenflik likes to call “earned conclusions” These are not opinions  these are conclusions that come from months and months of obsessive hard work For example the lead of the story Trump “participated in dubious tax schemes during the s” that included “instances of outright fraud” That is quite a conclusion One of Trump’s pitbull lawyers Charles Harder sent a statement to the NYT on Monday after the paper sent him a “detailed description of its findings” Harder said “The New York Times’s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are  percent false and highly defamatory There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate” A statement from Sanders or from Trump Harder’s statement was followed by a release from Sarah Sanders WH reporters pointed out that it sounded like it came straight from Trump’s mouth “But the statement doesn’t dispute any facts in the story” the NYT’s Peter Baker tweeted “Instead it attacks the newspaper and repeats the lie that the NYT apologized for  coverage which it did not” Fox’s spin Here’s the thing about an month investigation like this There’s no real way for other news outlets to “match” the story for days or more realistically for weeks or months So other outlets have to report it with attribution to the NYT I found it funny when Fox’s Kevin Corke told viewers during the  pm hour “we’ll keep digging” How Well he said he had reached out to WH officials I can’t think of a worse possible way to report on Trump’s taxes Anchor Neil Cavuto meanwhile downplayed the story by saying “I don’t know if there’s a there there” This is one of those times when Fox’s coverage actually does a disservice to its viewers There’s still so much we don’t know This story is about the Trump family with documents dating back decades But what about Trump’s more recent tax returns His more recent accounting practices “The records reviewed by the Times did not include Trump’s personal tax returns or his recent business dealings” CNN’s story notes Craig tweeted “It really underscores the need for presidents  Donald Trump in particular  to release their tax returns” Baker tweeted a similar point “Trump could help clarify anything he thinks is misleading by releasing his tax returns as every other president has done for decades”  MORE TO COME Craig told me “We have a lot more we want to dig into”  TUNE IN Craig is booked on “GMA” and Barstow is booked on “New Day” Wednesday morning The day’s other Timesrelated news Oliver Darcy emails Earlier on Tuesday before the Trump wealth story came out the NYT tried to

Stock-Split Watch: 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Ready to Split,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-split-watch-5-artificial-082000510.html,2024-05-21T08:20:00Z,,finance.yahoo.com,The artificial intelligence revolution has caused a growth surge for the technologys enablers most of which reside in the semiconductor sector In fact the stock movements for these companies have been so strong that many now trade at very very high stock prices setting these AI beneficiaries up for a potential stock split Stock splits dont create or destroy any value on their own After all if a company has twice as many shares but half the stock price the companys total market cap remains the same However stock splits can help certain people afford shares if they dont have a broker that allows fractional share buying Moreover splits can increase a stocks liquidity which can help lowerbidask spreads for trading purposes and therefore attract larger funds to a stock Therefore even though the following five stocks have already had very strong runs a split could potentially drive these AI winners to even further upside  Nvidia First and most obvious on the list is AI GPU leader Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA Not only is Nvidia currently leading the entire AI revolution with its bestinclass AI chips and software ecosystem but it also has a history of stock splits While Nvidia split its stock a few times in the early s its most recent was a for split in July  Of course with the stock having quintupled since that split a mere three years ago and its share price reaching  as of this writing its not a stretch to the think the company may choose to split its stock again Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution well before other peers did giving it a long multiyear lead In fact Nvidia has been investing in its CUDA software ecosystem since  CUDA allows developers to program Nvidias graphics processors for data processing thus enabling AI Fast forward to the introduction of ChatGPT in late  and that foresight looks like a stroke of genius The year headstart on the competition has allowed for some nice network effects with AI developers building most of their applications with CUDA and making it difficult for competitors to make inroads But Nvidia isnt resting on its laurels last October management declared it would double the speed at which it introduces a new chip architecture from once every two years to once per year On that note management introduced its new Blackwell architecture in March which will be hitting the market in late  These new AI chips offer a big leap forward over even the current Hopper architecture offering  times the training performance and up to five times the inference performance over its predecessor Story continues Nvidia has its Q earnings release tomorrow on Wednesday May  and all indicators point to its strong AIfueled hypergrowth continuing Will Nvidia split its stock again Image source Getty Images  Super Micro Computer One AI stock that has had even better returns than Nvidia over the past three years is Super Micro Computer NASDAQ SMCI Sure a lot of Super Micros recent success is owed to Nvidias AI chips but SMCIs returns in the stock market have actually been far superior Since July  the last time Nvidia split its stock Nvidia is up by five times But Super Micros stock has increased a whopping  times over in less than three years As a result Super Micros stock price has appreciated to about  per share as of this writing setting it up for a potential split A good part of that outperformance was a result of Super Micros starting from a significantly lower valuation In the past its server products were thought of as commoditized with a lot of other competitors in the space But the AI revolution has exposed the business model strengths CEO Charles Liang had been cultivating for  years Architecting its servers out of building blocks or creating the smallest possible modules or server components independently then being able to build servers out of any combination of these components Super Micro has masscustomization capabilities that enable it to satisfy virtually any customer modification request Not only that but the architecture also saves on costs as parts of a server can be refreshed instead of having to replace an entire system Moreover Liang has stressed energyefficiency in its server design for some  years far before it was fashionable But with the enormous electricity needs and costs of AI servers Super Micros efficient designs are finding even more favor today And with offices right in the heart of Silicon Valley close to Nvidia and other chipmakers Super Micro is often able to stay ahead of competitors with the latest indemand features such as liquid cooling and is often firsttomarket with servers containing the latest and greatest chips While Super Micros PE ratio has ballooned from the single digits to  over just the past few years its also displaying the growth to back it up with a stunning  growth last quarter As such Id expect Super Micros share price to at least maintain these valuation levels with a stock split potentially in the cards Super Micro stock has seen the biggest gains from the AI revolution Image source Getty Images  Broadcom Another AI beneficiary is Broadcom NASDAQ AVGO thanks to two main factors First Broadcom makes the worlds leading networking and routing chips with its Tomahawk and Jericho brands and data center networking needs are exploding thanks to the dataintensive nature of AI Second Broadcom has applicationspecific integrated chip ASIC design IP that third parties can use to make AI accelerators In this area Broadcom has landed some big fish with both Alphabet and Meta Platforms using the companys ASICs to design their own inhouse AI accelerators As a result of its highly cashgenerative business and AIfueled growth Broadcom has seen its share price rally to over  per share That definitely puts it in the running for a stocksplit Of course the AI boost has only been the most recent catalyst pushing Broadcoms stock Even before the AI revolution Broadcom was an impressive winner thanks to CEO Hock Tans visionary acquisition strategy Over the past  years under his tenure Tan has sought to acquire strong semiconductor franchises then cutting costs as these defensible niche technologies are folded into the Broadcom corporate umbrella Then in  Tan expanded Broadcoms reach when it bought its first software company California Technologies diversifying the chipmaker into software albeit still within its main enterprise infrastructure market After buying cybersecurity firm Symantec in  Broadcom made its biggest purchase yet in VMware a software leader that enables hybrid cloud capabilities and data center virtualization VMware should also benefit from the growth of AI as customers use many clouds with unique capabilities while striving to keep their data safe in their own data centers As a result of the VMware acquisition which closed late last year Broadcoms software mix has grown to roughly  of revenues Now Broadcom isnt just a chipmaker but a diversified technology platform company with many ways to win Look for its profitable growth to remain strong in the years ahead Both chipmakers and equipment stocks are all benefiting from the AI revolution Image source Getty Images  ASML Holdings The path to making every leadingedge semiconductor Nvidia GPUs included runs through ASML Holdings NASDAQ ASML This is because the Netherlandsbased lithography company has a monopoly on key extreme ultraviolet lithography EUV technology needed to make todays most advanced chips EUV technology took some  years to develop with significant buyin from ASMLs customers to fund leading research so dont think that EUV capabilities can be copied anytime soon The resulting technology allows for chipmakers to draw extremely fine transistor designs with light wavelengths that do not occur naturally on earth And ASMLs latest version of EUV called highNA EUV can print designs down to widths of just nm ASML is set to rake in the dough from highNA just introduced late last year as these machines currently go for between  million and  million a pop EUV only began to be used commercially in  with the first EUVenabled products coming out in  So we are still only at the beginning of the EUV era As such ASML has seen its stock rocket  over the past five years reaching  per share thus making it a candidate for a stock split  Lam Research Like ASML Lam Research NASDAQ LRCX is a semiconductor equipment leader that has also seen shares rally over the semiconductor bull market But whereas ASML is the de facto leader in lithography which draws designs on a silicon wafer using extremely fine light Lams technology does the exacting and painstaking work of etching the printed design and then depositing semiconductor material in extremely intricate patterns to construct the chip While Lam doesnt have a clear monopoly over etch and deposition technology like ASML does with EUV Lam actually does have a monopoly over certain process steps in the chipmaking process More specifically Lam dominates the deposition technology crucial to stacking chip components in a vertical fashion Over the past decade or so that has led to Lam benefiting from the production of D NAND flash chips in which memorymakers stack storage modules in a D fashion in greater and greater numbers of layers with every generation Now logic and DRAM chips crucial for AI are also going vertical including highbandwidth memory DRAM that is currently seeing such strong demand from AI applications In fact on its January conference call with analysts Lam management noted it had a  market share in certain technologies needed for stacking DRAM modules And with new gateallaround transistors and D designs making their way into logic chips look for Lam to get a further AI boost in the years ahead Thats why shares have rocketed  over the past five years to  per share as of this writing setting this strong compounder up for a possible stock split as well Should you invest  in Nvidia right now Before you buy stock in Nvidia consider this The Motley Fool Stock

"Red Lobster is blaming its bankruptcy on top shareholder and its ex-CEO, saying an $11M all-you-can-eat-shrimp fiasco contributed to its demise",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/red-lobster-blaming-bankruptcy-top-112454092.html,2024-05-21T11:24:54Z,,finance.yahoo.com,The new CEO at seafood chain Red Lobster said an endless shrimp deal was a nail in the coffin for the brand which filed for bankruptcy this week While restaurants for the crab lobster and seafood brand remain open incoming CEO Jonathan Tibus—a restructuring advisor—is picking over the decisions of his predecessor and appears to be left unimpressed Tibus who is also managing director at consulting firm Alvarez  Marsals North America division called out Red Lobsters former boss Paul Kenny for marketing and operational missteps In a Chapter  declaration seen by Fortune Tibus wrote Certain operational decisions by former management have harmed the debtors’ Red Lobster financial situation in recent years Historically the debtors’ Ultimate Endless Shrimp “UES” promotion was utilized as a limitedtime promotion In May  however Paul Kenny the debtors’ former CEO made the decision to add UES as a permanent  item to the menu despite significant pushback from other members of the companys management team The decision cost the Floridabased brand  million and also saddled the business with burdensome supply obligations relating to one business in particular Thai Union which acquired a  stake in the company in  Thai Union is a producer of seafood products supplying ambient frozen and and chilled seafood to clients through retail channels like restaurants and wholesalers Even at the time Thai Union said it knew the business wouldnt make much money from the promotion During an earnings call last year Thai Union CFO Ludovic Garnier said “On this promotion we don’t earn a lot of money At  we don’t The idea was to bring some traffic Some revisions upward of the  price tag to  stemmed some of the flow but according to CNN Garnier added We need to be much more careful regarding what is the entry point And what is the price point we’re offering for this promotion Even hiking the prices on the popular but illfated promotion couldnt bandage the wound In January this year Thai Union announced its intention to cut ties with Red Lobster saying Red Lobster’s ongoing financial requirements no longer align with our capital allocation priorities In the first nine months of —during the time Red Lobsters UES offer became permanent—Thai Union recorded a share of loss from the chain worth  million Story continues Tibus seems unimpressed by Kennys decision tying a sinking Red Lobster deal to a seafood supplier which conveniently held a lot of sway in the boardroom The UES promotion according to Tibus also got an atypical amount of promotion regarding the deal which in turn led to supply issues resulting in major shortages of shrimp with restaurants often going days or weeks without certain types of shrimp Thai Union and Red Lobster did not immediately respond to Fortunes request for comment Fishy business But the restructuring expert is also picking through other choices made under Kennys leadership in relation to an increasing dependence on Thai Union supply The shareholder—which had a market cap of approximately  billion at the time of writing—had an outsized influence on the company’s shrimp purchasing the new CEO has alleged This influence was made clear through a number of decisions Tibus claims In  for example Kenny directed Thai Union to continue producing shrimp for Red Lobster in levels which did not flow through the traditional supply process or bid cycle or adhere to the company’s demand projections Thai Union products also began appearing more widely in Red Lobster restaurants after two breaded shrimp suppliers previously used by the chain were axed which Tibus claimed happened under the guise of a quality review The dismissal of these two suppliers led to an exclusive deal for Thai Union and higher costs for the restaurant brand Outside factors While a multimilliondollar shrimp debacle may not have helped Red Lobsters outlook the brand did say in its Chapter  filing it had liabilities between  billion and  billion—an amount too large to be laid entirely at the feet of any allyoucaneat seafood promotion In its extraction from Red Lobster Thai Union said the brand was battling aftereffects from the pandemic as well as sustained industry headwinds higher interest rates and rising material and labor costs Indeed the analysis Tibus and his team has produced since March paints a picture of a business drowning in problems Among the issues he outlines in his declaration is a falling customer count down  since  with only a marginal bounce back after COVID On top of that is a factor blighting the industry more widely inflation Consumers are less likely to want to eat out at the moment Tibus wrote adding that this drop in customer revenue has been coupled with higher labor costs on account of increasing minimumwage bills Elsewhere the boss added the company is spending eyewatering sums on leasing stores which arent making a return on investment He wrote In  the company spent approximately  million in lease obligations over m of which relate to underperforming stores This situation may have already changed Per USA Today  restaurants across  states on the Red Lobster website—which is not functioning at the time of writing—were shown as temporarily closed This story

Cathie Wood Pulls the Trigger on These 2 ‘Strong Buy’ Stocks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-pulls-trigger-2-013206589.html,2024-05-21T01:32:06Z,,finance.yahoo.com,Cathie Wood is famous for her singular investing style Favoring high growth and disruptors she often appears to be throwing caution to the wind and willing to tread where other Wall Street titans may fear to go However outr Wood’s strategy might seem to some there’s one risk she’s not willing to take Addressing the recent comeback of meme stocks the Ark Invest CEO recently issued a warning to investors keen to get in on the action sensibly warning that it will end badly for many piling into speculative names such as GameStop and AMC “Buyer beware there were a lot of people in the first meme stock craze who got hurt badly” Wood commented That said it’s not as if Wood has suddenly turned to value investing for inspiration Still following her playbook of exposure to innovators we’ve decided to get the lowdown on two of the less lauded names that make up part of her Ark Invest portfolio Here it appears that the Street is in sync with the Wood view according to the TipRanks database both these stocks are rated as Strong Buys by the analyst consensus Let’s see why Prime Medicine PRME The first Woodbacked stock we’ll look at fits Wood’s innovationfocused investing style perfectly Prime Medicine is a biotech company operating at the forefront of gene editing Founded in  the company’s innovative approach centers on its Prime Editing platform a breakthrough technology that allows for precise and flexible editing of the human genome Unlike traditional CRISPR methods which typically create doublestrand breaks in DNA Prime Editing uses a more refined method involving a ‘searchandreplace’ technique to make specific alterations This method significantly reduces the risk of unintended mutations enhancing the safety and effectiveness of genetic therapies Prime Medicine’s tech holds promise for treating a wide array of genetic disorders potentially providing cures for conditions that currently have limited or no treatment options The company’s development efforts span key strategic areas including hematology liver eye neuromuscular and lung although most of the pipeline is still in the preclinical stage One drug however is now advancing to the clinic In April the FDA gave the goahead for the company’s IND investigational new drug application for PM its Prime Editor indicated to treat chronic granulomatous disease CGD This is the firstever Prime Editor product candidate to get this far and Prime plans on initiating a Phase  trial of the drug with an initial data readout from the study slated for  Story continues Meanwhile Wood significantly bolstered Ark Invest’s stake in PRME during Q acquiring  million shares The firm’s total holdings now stand at nearly  million shares currently worth  million That will probably be considered a good move by Chardan analyst Geulah Livshits who also likes the look of what’s on offer here “The platform nature of its tech means the company should be able to move more quickly for subsequent programs using the same manufacturing and delivery tech” explained the star analyst “Additionally the current regulatory environment is highly supportive of transformative therapies for rare diseases with FDA officials repeatedly indicating a desire to accelerate the development of such therapies including via greater engagement use of surrogate endpoints and flexible trial designs We believe this these factors can enable Prime to achieve sustained growth by advancing programs across and beyond its current pipeline” “With Prime on track to initiate INDenabling activities for  programs in its in vivo liver franchise and to nominate a DC in for RHO adRP in  we believe the company is positioned for value inflection as it transitions from developing a collection of interesting science projects to advancing a product pipeline” Livshits went on to say Bottomline Livshits rates PRME shares a Buy while her  price target suggests the stock has room for outsized growth of  over the coming year To watch Livshits’ track record click here Livshits’ bullish take on PRME is no anomaly All the  other recent analyst reviews are positive naturally making the consensus view here a Strong Buy With an average target of  investors could potentially see returns of  within the next year See PRME stock forecast AbSci ABSI We’ll stay in the biotech space for Wood’s next pick AbSci is a company that makes use of the current market’s hottest trend  it utilizes generative AI for drug development Describing itself as an AI drug creation company AbSci’s platform can produce highaffinity antibodies targeting specific epitopes entirely through computer simulations Reflecting their motto “the data to train the AI to create and the wet lab to validate” AbSci can generate antibody drug candidates much faster than traditional lab techniques By streamlining what are traditionally laborious steps AbSci aims to lower costs and reduce the timetomarket for new biologic drugs thereby addressing critical needs in healthcare This said the pipeline is still in its early stages Amongst drugs being developed the company is working on ABS potentially a bestinclass antiTLA antibody for which it initiated INDenabling studies in February The company anticipates Phase  clinical studies for ABS will kick off early next year with an interim data readout slated for the second half of  Additionally proofofconcept results for novel immuneoncology drug candidate ABS are anticipated around mid As for Wood’s involvement her firm Ark Invest initiated a new position in ABSI stock during Q acquiring nearly  million shares valued at  million The company also has a fan in Scotiabank’s George Farmer who thinks investors should clock an opportunity while still in its infancy “We recommend buying ABSI shares to capture the value potential of the company’s novel AI based drug development strategy and the earlystage biologics pipeline on which it is based” Farmer noted “Why Preclinical results to date support the competitive advantage that lead asset ABS an AIoptimized antiTLA therapeutic may have over existing agents in clinical development for addressing the massive inflammatory bowel disease IBD treatment market” To this end Farmer rates ABSI as an Outperform ie Buy alongside a  price target The implication for investors Upside of a handsome  from current levels To watch Farmer’s track record click here Most of

Time to Pounce: 2 Ultra-High-Yield S&P 500 Dividend Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-pounce-2-ultra-high-092100676.html,2024-05-21T09:21:00Z,,finance.yahoo.com,Stocks have been a wealthcreating machine for investors over the long run Though other asset classes have delivered a positive nominal return to patient investors including gold oil housing and Treasury bonds none have come close to the annualized total return stocks have generated over the last century While innovation is a key growth driver on Wall Street dividend investing has fueled this longterm outperformance Last year investment advisory firm Hartford Funds released a report that examined the insandouts of just how superior dividend stocks have been over long periods when compared to publicly traded companies that dont offer a payout In a collaboration with Ned Davis Research Hartford Funds report The Power of Dividends Past Present and Future found that dividendpaying stocks had more than doubled up the annualized returns of nonpayers   vs   over the previous  years  Image source Getty Images The great thing about dividend investing is that amazing deals can always be found One of the best places to locate clearasday income bargains hiding in plain sight is within the benchmark SP  SNPINDEX GSPC The SP  is comprised of  of the largest timetested multinational businesses traded on US stock exchanges Approximately  of these  businesses pays a regular dividend to their shareholders Companies that pay a consistent dividend tend to be profitable on a recurring basis and can provide transparent longterm growth outlooks But no two dividend stocks are created equally The SP  is comprised of just over a dozen ultrahighyield dividend stocks  ie companies with yields that are at least four times greater than the  yield of the SP  Two of these ultrahighyield SP  dividend stocks are nothing short of screaming buys right now Time to pounce Pfizer  yield The first highoctane SP  dividend stock thats begging to be bought by opportunistic income seekers is none other than pharmaceutical colossus Pfizer NYSE PFE In late April Pfizers stock hit a decadelow of around  per share which equated to a  decline from its alltime high that was achieved during the COVID pandemic in December  This precipitous decline came after a period of immense operating success for the company PFE Revenue Annual Chart During the pandemic Pfizer was one of a very small number of drug developers to have successfully engineered a COVID vaccine known as Comirnaty as well as an oral therapy known as Paxlovid to lessen the severity of COVID symptoms Combined sales of Comirnaty and Paxlovid have declined from a peak of more than  billion in  to an estimated  billion this year Having to absorb a  billion retracement in COVID sales hasnt sat well with Wall Street or investors Story continues But if income seekers dig beneath the surface and look at the entirety of Pfizers novel drug portfolio and pipeline theyre going to find a company thats meaningfully strengthened itself since the decade began For example Pfizers vast drug portfolio excluding its duo of COVID therapies has continued to grow After delivering  operating sales growth ex COVID therapies in  the companys COVIDexcluded therapies grew by  on a constantcurrency basis during the Marchended quarter To add to the above many of Pfizers mostimportant therapies are breaking through new ceilings Sales of blockbuster bloodthinning drug Eliquis topped the  billion in the March quarter while its Vyndaqel family of products enjoyed operational sales growth of  to  billion to begin the year Something else investors need to consider is that Pfizer completed a  billion acquisition of cancerdrug developer Seagen in December Although this acquisition is expected to negatively impact earnings per share EPS in the current year cost synergies coupled with a vastly expanded oncology pipeline should be meaningfully accretive to Pfizers EPS in the years to come The shortsightedness of select investors is giving patient income seekers an incredible opportunity to snag shares of Pfizer on the cheap Speaking of cheap shares of Pfizer are trading at roughly  times forwardyear earnings This represents a  discount to its average multiple to forward earnings over the trailingfiveyear period The cherry on the sundae is that Pfizer confirmed its dividend which is nearing a  yield is perfectly safe According to Chief Financial Officer David Denton Our No  priority from a capital allocation perspective is both supporting and growing our dividend over time  and that is not at risk Image source Getty Images Time to pounce Walgreens Boots Alliance  yield The second ultrahighyield SP  dividend stock that income seekers can confidently pounce on right now is beatendown pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance NASDAQ WBA Whereas Pfizer has been a victim of its own success Walgreens stock is most definitely flailing because of its own failures While not a comprehensive list Walgreens has been contending with Growing online pharmacy competition from the likes of Amazon  A challenging retail environment thats not been helped by increased shrinkage ie theft at some of its stores The costly launch and expansion of its healthcare services operations which resulted in a  billion writedown in the fiscal second quarter ended Feb   Ongoing legal challenges that have included its role in the opioid crisis A nearhalving of its dividend from quarter to quarter to begin the current calendar year In other words there are tangible reasons why Walgreens Boots Alliance has declined by  since its stock hit an alltime closing high in  The good news is that there appears to be light at the end of the tunnel for patient investors The biggest and mostneeded change for Walgreens is that it brought in Tim Wentworth as its new CEO in October Wentworth has decades of experience in the healthcare arena having previously served as the CEO of Express Scripts the largest pharmacybenefit manager in the US Prior CEO Rosalind Brewer didnt have a healthcare background which ultimately proved to be a detriment to the company While Wentworths approach may cause some temporary growing pains he understands how to right the ship for the long haul Another exciting change for Walgreens is its aforementioned shift to healthcare services Though its a bit tardy building out its healthcareservice operations its investment in and partnership with VillageMD should prove profitable in the years to come The differentiator here is that Walgreens is operating fullservice health clinics Whereas most pharmacy chains can do no more than administer a vaccine or treat a sniffle VillageMDs clinics that are colocated in Walgreens stores have physicians onsite Building a base of loyal patients should steadily expand this new revenue stream for Walgreens Walgreens Boots Alliance also hasnt been shy about spending on various digital growth initiatives Its leaned on digitization to improve the efficiency of its supply chain as well as beef up its directtoconsumer segment While Walgreens will continue to generate the bulk of its revenue from its physical locations bolstering its online sales and making things convenient for consumers is an easy way to lift its organic growth rate Costcutting is playing a role too After reaching a cumulative  billion in reduced annual operating expenses by the end of fiscal  the company is now targeting  billion in aggregate annual cost reductions by the end of the current fiscal year This should provide a boost to the companys margins as well as EPS The final piece of the puzzle is that Walgreens Boots Alliance is dirt cheap Shares can be added by opportunistic investors for less than  times forwardyear earnings This is a  discount to its average forwardyear multiple over the last five years and one heck of a deal with a  dividend yield in tow Should you invest  in Pfizer right now Before you buy stock in Pfizer consider this The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the  best stocks for investors to buy now and Pfizer wasn’t one of them The  stocks that

Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling It and Buying These 2 Supercharged Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks Instead,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-nvidia-billionaires-selling-buying-090600532.html,2024-05-21T09:06:00Z,,finance.yahoo.com,Since the advent of the internet roughly  years ago there have been no shortage of nextbigthing investment trends and innovations that promised to change the growth arc for corporate America Unfortunately none have come close to their billed expectations However artificial intelligence AI appears ready to give the internet revolution a run for its money AI involves the use of software and systems in place of humans In many instances these systems have the ability to learn and evolve without human intervention AIdriven software and systems becoming more proficient at their tasks or perhaps even learning new tasks gives the technology utility across almost every sector and industry Its the driving force behind PwCs otherworldly estimation that AI can add  trillion to the global economy by  However not all of Wall Streets brightest investment minds are in agreement on how best to play the AI revolution Although no company has benefited more directly from the rise of AI than semiconductor behemoth Nvidia NASDAQ NVDA the latest round of Form F filings that details trading activity during the Marchended quarter shows billionaires were once again headed for the exit Image source Getty Images Eight billionaire investors ran for the exit from Nvidia during the first quarter Nvidia which is set to report its latest quarterly operating results on Wednesday May  has undeniably benefited from the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence The companys graphics processing units GPUs have become the standard in highcompute data centers More specifically the H GPU is the goto for businesses looking to train large language models and operate generative AI solutions Last year Nvidias fiscal year ended on January  this surge in demand for AIGPUs more than doubled the companys fullyear sales and sent Data Center segment revenue screaming higher by  Whats particularly interesting about Nvidias growth in fiscal  is that it was predominantly driven by the companys phenomenal pricing power on its AI chips With demand overwhelming supply Nvidia had no trouble increasing the price of its topselling GPUs Despite these catalysts eight billionaire money managers  technically nine if you include recently passed billionaire Jim Simons who founded Renaissance Technologies  were sellers of Nvidia stock in the first quarter including total shares sold in parenthesis Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management  shares Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors  shares Israel Englander of Millennium Management  shares Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office  shares John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments  shares David Tepper of Appaloosa Management  shares Steven Cohen of Point Asset Management  shares Story continues The primary reason these billionaires continued to show Nvidia shares to the door might very well be history There hasnt been a single nextbigthing trend or innovation for three decades that didnt work its way through an early innings bubble Investors often overestimate the adoptionuptake of new technologies leading to bubbles There isnt a stock that would be hurt more in the short run by the AI bubble bursting than Nvidia These more than halfdozen billionaire asset managers are likely also thinking about how competition will adversely impact Nvidia Both Intel and Advanced Micro Devices have introduced AIaccelerating GPUs thatll go to headtohead with Nvidias H in highcompute data centers But the bigger concern might be the competition Nvidia is facing from within Its four top customers  Microsoft Meta Platforms Amazon and Alphabet  make up about  of its net sales But all four of these industry leaders are currently developing AI chips of their own Even if these chips are purely to complement Nvidias H GPUs it means reduced orders after the current year Lastly increased competition will reduce the AIGPU scarcity thats allowed Nvidia to raise its prices into the stratosphere As its pricing power declines so should its gross margin Yet not every AI stock found itself on the chopping block by Wall Streets smartest money managers in the first quarter The following two supercharged artificial intelligence growth stocks were popular buys Image source Getty Images CrowdStrike Holdings The first AI stock that whet the whistle of Wall Street billionaires as they were dumping shares of Nvidia in the Marchended quarter is cybersecurity juggernaut CrowdStrike Holdings NASDAQ CRWD Four prominent billionaires upped their positions in the latest quarter including total shares purchased in parenthesis Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors  shares Israel Englander of Millennium Management  shares John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments  shares The great thing about cybersecurity is that its steadily evolved into a basic necessity service Businesses of any size that have an online or cloudbased presence require protection at all times from robots and hackers that seek to steal their sensitive information Subscriptiondriven thirdparty cybersecurity solution providers like CrowdStrike are finding their services in high demand The secret sauce that makes CrowdStrike tick is its Falcon security platform Falcon is cloudnative reliant on AI and machine learning and oversees trillions of events each week This is to say that its becoming more efficient at recognizing and responding to potential threats over time The testament to this efficacy can be seen in its gross retention rate Despite not being the cheapest endpoint security provider by any measure gross retention has increased from below  to a pretty consistent  in less than seven years Businesses have demonstrated a willingness to pay more for a product thats successfully defending against breaches Furthermore CrowdStrikes existing clients are spending more with the company as they grow In fiscal  a singledigit percentage of its customers had purchased four or more cloudmodule subscriptions As of Jan   the end of the companys latest fiscal year  of its customers had adopted five or more cloud modules These addon sales are rapidly pushing the company toward its operating model goal of an adjusted subscription gross margin of  to  Palantir Technologies A second supercharged artificial intelligence growth stock that billionaires were buying as they reduced their respective stakes in Nvidia is datamining specialist Palantir Technologies NYSE PLTR Newly filed Fs show that five successful billionaires purchased shares of Palantir in the quarter ended in March including total shares purchased in parenthesis John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments  shares Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management  shares Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office  shares Israel Englander of Millennium Management  shares One of the main reasons billionaires have been attracted to Palantir is its unique operating model The companys AIdriven Gotham platform helps federal governments collect data and plan missions among other tasks Meanwhile the more recently launched Foundry platform is geared at helping larger businesses make sense of their big data in order to streamline their operations At scale no company comes close to doing what Palantir can On Wall Street irreplaceability can be quite valuable For years Palantirs Gotham platform was responsible for much of its growth Government contracts are typically spread out over four of five years which leads to highly predictable cash flow But this is a segment with a ceiling In other words there are certain countries eg China that Palantirs management would never allow access to Gotham Although its still relatively early in its launch phase Foundry is on track to be Palantirs longterm breadwinner Palantir closed out the first quarter with  commercial customers which represents a  improvement over the yearago quarter US commercial customer count growth was even faster up  yearoveryear to  As Palantir lands larger businesses with Foundry it should see its cash flow meaningfully expand The final selling point for billionaires with Palantir is its balance sheet The company closed out March with nearly  billion in combined cash cash equivalents and marketable securities with no debt Its a company thats ready for whatever the US and global economy throws its way Where to invest  right now When our analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen After all

promise and commitment he made when we divorced I understood that our divorce agreement specified that I should remain beneficiary of his lifeinsurance policy — that is how I remember it I hoped but I never fully trusted that he would follow through on that He was never faithful in our marriage and he took pride in stiffing people he did business with and not paying his bills Once a cheater always a cheater Most Read from MarketWatch ExWife  Mother “Roughly half of US states have some form of revocationupondivorce statute that automatically removes an exspouse as a lifeinsurance beneficiary after divorce”  MarketWatch illustration Dear ExWife The answer my friend should be in your divorce decree “Assuming there is a lifeinsurance requirement in the divorce decree it should spell out who will pay the premiums” according to MassMutual “It is important to have defined clear terms and responsibilities as it could be detrimental to the beneficiaries if the premiums do not get paid If you have added your exspouse to the policy you may request to receive copies of billing records and lapse notices” People usually add a provision to say the beneficiary cannot be changed without their consent At the time of your divorce you and your attorney should have clearly defined the policy owner MassMutual adds “This is important because the policy owner has the ability to change beneficiaries rates and insurability which can help protect your income It is also possible to sign over the ownership of an existing policy prior to divorce proceedings” Story continues You don’t mention what kind of lifeinsurance policy your husband holds A termlife policy lasts anywhere from  to  years and if your exhusband outlived that period the policy would expire and the beneficiaries wouldn’t receive any money A wholelife policy on the other hand has a cash value and for that reason costs more than a termlife policy Once a wholelife policy has built up significant monetary value the insured person can cash it out or borrow against it It’s not so unusual for a spouse to fail to comply with a divorce decree over a lifeinsurance policy The spouse could cancel the policy replace it or even change the beneficiaries There are several issues here First it is your former husband’s responsibility to pay for the lifeinsurance policy and not make it his children’s responsibility It’s unfortunate unfair and petty that he is putting them in the middle of your dispute In Hillman vs Maretta the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of a yearold man’s exwife rather than his widow as the beneficiary of a lifeinsurance policy worth over  In this case he may not have wanted his exwife whom he had divorced  years before his death to claim his lifeinsurance policy But the divorce decree didn’t matter because the document given to the insurance company had his exwife’s name on it State law varies If your divorce decree was not clear regarding the beneficiary of your exhusband’s lifeinsurance policy the outcome may depend on the laws of your state Can a divorce decree override a lifeinsurance policy “Yes If the policyholder was married in a community property state and got divorced the exspouse may be entitled to some of the death benefit regardless of who is the named beneficiary” according to Boonswang Law in Philadelphia Roughly half of US states — including Florida Pennsylvania New Jersey New York Texas Massachusetts and Colorado — have some form of revocationupondivorce statute that automatically removes an exspouse as a lifeinsurance beneficiary after divorce the law firm adds California law meanwhile excludes lifeinsurance policies from automatic revocationupondivorce laws A lifeinsurance beneficiary for a former spouse in California will pass muster according to Carina Castaeda a lawyer in Manhattan Beach Calif “unless the property settlement or divorce decree specifically provides for a contrary result the policyholder changes the beneficiary designation an insurance contract nulls the beneficiary designation upon divorce or the former spouse legally waives their interest in the policy” We would all like to believe that former spouses will keep their word and perhaps act in a more honorable manner than they did during the marriage whether it’s regarding child support alimony lifeinsurance policies or retirement accounts But divorce doesn’t necessarily change people In many cases it can present an opportunity for a former spouse to again wield whatever power they have to create disruption in the life of their ex Your divorce attorney should be able to advise you as to what action you can take based on the laws in your state and the exact wording of your divorce decree Beneficiary disputes as that aforementioned case suggests can be extremely complex and challenging to win They can also if they end up going to a higher court and dragging out for years be hugely expensive Your legal adviser will be able to tell you whether it’s worth it Stay strong stay focused — and don’t let your ex get under your skin Previous columns by Quentin Fottrell My husband spent  on repairs to my house before we were married Does the

buying stocks on a dip rather than during or after a rally Why pay more when you can pay less Paying less means more eventual profits Sometimes though its worth jumping into a stock while its on the way up There may not be a pullback coming anytime soon Waiting could end up being costly instead of helpful With that as the backdrop heres a closer look at three such soaring stocks to consider stepping into now despite their current strength Theres too good of a chance for more immediate upside MercadoLibre If youve never heard of MercadoLibre NASDAQ MELI dont sweat it Plenty of people havent Thats because it only operates its business in Latin America But what a business it operates MercadoLibre is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America and its not an unfair description Its incomplete though In addition to its online malls as well as dedicated companyspecific shopping carts this company also offers online and mobile payment services plus logistics services to support these online operations In many ways the companys just as much like Shopify PayPal and eBay In fact it was more of an eBay clone in its early days More important to current and prospective shareholders MercadoLibre is very much in the right place at the right time with the right lineup of services How so In many ways South America is now where North America was  years ago Although the region has certainly had highspeed internet and mobile phones for many years these things are only just beginning to become common in the region Atlantico reports that between  and  the continents internet penetration rate grew from  to  Thats a big change in just one decade Yet access to the web still isnt universal SP Global Market Intelligence says that only a little over half of Latin Americas homes have access to broadband service while market research firm Phocuswright suggests Latin Americas mobile phone penetration rate will only reach  by  The point is while South Americas ecommerce industry may not yet compare to North Americas the stage is set for massive growth as the industry matures there A forecast from Payments and Commerce Market Intelligence indicates the regions ecommerce market is likely to swell to the tune of  this year and expand by  next year and then again the year after that For its part MercadoLibre is expected to grow its top line by  this year and then another  in  Story continues Connect the dots All the pieces of MercadoLibres puzzle are finally falling into place Thats why the stocks making forward progress And theres much more progress to be made ahead DraftKings DraftKings NASDAQ DKNG shares are up more than  since the end of  and still within sight of the week high hit in March A move of that size can certainly be intimidating to wouldbe buyers Dont be intimidated though This rally is likely to persist for a long while As you may already know DraftKings is a sportsbetting stock While its roots are in the fantasy sports business s lift of the federal ban on sportsbased wagering started a wave of statelevel legalization As of the latest count betting on sports is legal in one way or another in  US states But that doesnt mean most of DraftKings revenue and earnings growth is in the rearview mirror for a couple of reasons First two of the nations largest states Texas and California dont yet permit sports betting Legalization measures continue surfacing in both states though and it seems reasonable that it should happen sooner or later Second and perhaps more important it takes time for DraftKings business to reach its maximum potential even when a state legalizes its presence just as it takes time for a bettor to become profitable once they become a DraftKings app user The company reports the average customer doesnt become gross profitable until the third year after theyre acquired after theyve been betting a while and tend to wager more Image source DraftKings November

few years prior in many ways the COVID pandemic  and then the postpandemic fallout  has proven a businessbuilding boon for the retailer Walmart is one of the few retailers thats been able to maintain the availability of a wide assortment of merchandise still sold at reasonably low prices This is largely the result of sheer scale and the leverage its used when dealing with its vendors A year ago

How Can I Do a Roth Conversion in Retirement If I Don't Have Earned Income?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/roth-conversion-retirement-dont-earned-100000246.html,2024-05-21T10:00:00Z,,finance.yahoo.com,In a previous article about Roth conversions an advisor wrote For many folks a prime time for Roth conversions takes place during the years after retirement but before Social Security and RMDs kick in Those can be relatively lowincome years during which initiating a conversion can result in a triple benefit Those benefits are lower tax bills reduced RMDs and future taxfree growth My question is based on what I thought the rules were for Roth contributions which is that you must have earned income to contribute How can a retiree roll funds into a Roth IRA without having any earned income  Mark Thats a great question and I get some variation of it often Unfortunately there is a lot of nuance to the rules surrounding Roth IRAs The recent column on the five year rules highlights this point too This can make following them more complicated and confusing than you might think The answer to your specific question simply lies in understanding some subtle differences in terminology While you need earned income to contribute to a Roth IRA directly earned income isn’t required to convert a pretax account into a Roth IRA If you have similar questions surrounding retirement planning consider working with a financial advisor Roth Contributions vs Roth Conversions A retiree looks over his retirement accounts and contemplates doing a Roth conversion To be clear your understanding of the Roth contribution rules is spot on Contributions must come from earned income Therefore a retiree who is only collecting Social Security pensions annuity payments interest or taking distributions from retirement plans cannot contribute to a Roth IRA or a traditional taxdeferred IRA for that matter But Roth conversions and Roth contributions are not the same thing When you make a Roth contribution you take money that’s already been taxed and direct it into a Roth account There it will grow taxfree and won’t be subject to required minimum distributions RMDs which start at age   for people who reach age  after Dec   A Roth contribution can be made with money you receive from a paycheck or money that’s your checking account The key is you need earned income in order to contribute to a Roth IRA A conversion on the other hand takes money that’s already inside a taxdeferred account and moves it over to a Roth account The “conversion” occurs because you pay income taxes on the money when you move it into a Roth account In order to do a conversion you must first have money inside a taxdeferred retirement account of some type like a traditional IRA or k for example Story continues In short the source of a Roth contribution is earned income The source of a Roth conversion is a taxdeferred retirement account Roth conversions are just one type of taxplanning strategy that a financial advisor may be able to help you with Limitations While Roth contributions are limited in a number of ways there are no limits whatsoever on Roth conversions For tax year  the Roth IRA contribution limit is  for those under  and  for those  and older There are no limit on the amount of money you are allowed to convert however You’ll also want to keep the income limits in mind If your earned income is too high you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA at all In  that limit is  for single tax filers and  if you’re married and file jointly While not everyone can contribute directly to a Roth IRA there is no income limitations on Roth conversions Bill Gates could do a Roth conversion if he wanted to But if you need additional help navigating the rules surrounding Roth accounts consider working with a financial advisor Roth Accounts in Workplace Retirement Plans Different rules govern Roth IRAs and Roth ks including income and contribution limits A related issue that is often the source of confusion is the treatment of Roth accounts within workplace retirement plans Often retirement savers believe that the same income restrictions that prevent them from contributing to a Roth IRA also prevent them from contributing to a Roth b or Roth b However that is not true The Roth IRA income limits do not apply to designated Roth accounts within workplace retirement plans As a result a single person who earns over  in  could contribute up to  to a Roth k if their employer offers this account option If you need advice on how to split your retirement savings contributions between pretax and Roth accounts consider talking it over with a fiduciary financial advisor Bottom Line Roth contributions and Roth conversions are not the same thing and they are not bound by the same rules Any amount you convert will be included in your taxable income in the year of the conversion but then qualified withdrawals will be taxfree in the future Roth conversions can be part of an effective taxplanning strategy but you shouldnt do them without careful analysis Tips for Executing a Roth Conversion Converting a large retirement savings balance into a Roth IRA all at once can have serious tax implications That’s why you may want to consider a more gradual approach that sees you convert your pretax savings into a Roth account over the course of several years That way you can spread the tax hit more evenly and potentially avoid jumping into a higher tax bracket A financial advisor may be able to help plan your Roth conversions Finding a financial advisor doesnt have to be hard SmartAssets free tool matches you with up to three vetted

usage continues to rise slowly Source Altria Investor Presentation With a dominant market share in a stable steadily growing end market Altria has been able to pay outsized dividends throughout nearly any market condition  the  financial crisis being the only time over the last  years that the dividend has been cut The current yield however is now over  its highest level in more than a decade This elevated dividend yield is the result of a couple of things First the dividend payout has continued to rise buoyed by rising cash flows Since  cash from operations has roughly doubled The second reason is a struggling stock price This is where investors should get excited Story continues While Altria has proven its ability to perform well across both bull and bear markets shares often struggle during dramatic market upturns like the one we are experiencing right now Thats because the company cant grow faster at the flip of a switch The companys main advantage  a stable slowgrowth

How Do I Avoid Paying Tax on Dividends?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/avoid-paying-tax-dividends-130000538.html,2024-05-20T22:40:47Z,,finance.yahoo.com,How Do I Avoid Paying Tax on Dividends Many of us dream about receiving a financial windfall but the majority of us won’t know what to do with the money when the time comes A financial advisor can help you manage an inheritance or other financial windfall Find a fiduciary financial advisor today According to New York Life’s Wealth Watch Survey only  of adults who expect to get some kind of inheritance said they feel very comfortable handling the new wealth that will be passed down In addition the survey found women are nearly twice as uncertain about managing an inheritance While  of men who expect an inheritance said they had doubts  of women said they had fears How Much Money People Expect to Inherit One reason that people lack confidence in managing their eventual inheritance may be the size of the anticipated bequest The New York Life survey found that on average people expect to receive a whopping  “Navigating competing priorities and family dynamics while grieving can make it even harder to know where to start or where to get reliable and objective advice” said Suzanne Schmitt head of financial wellness at New York Life “While Baby Boomers are the most likely generation to say they prefer to get guidance from a financial advisor or tax professional  Gen Xers and Millennials two cohorts set to inherit from Baby Boomers through  could benefit from seeking professional advice too” she also said Then again data across various studies shows that people’s expectations of their eventual inheritances are often misaligned with what they’ll actually end up receiving A financial advisor can give you expert advice on how to navigate an inheritance and integrate it into your financial goals Get matched with a fiduciary financial advisor for free The Great Wealth Transfer A woman signs some estate plan paperwork in front her daughter However trillions of dollars will be inherited in the coming years in what’s being called “The Great Wealth Transfer” The massive transfer of wealth will see the aging Baby Boomers pass as much as  trillion primarily to Generation X and Millennials To put it in perspective that amount of money is more than  times the combined gross domestic product of California Texas and New York According to the statistics compiled by New York Life in the study this wave of wealth transfers is already underway  of adults received an inheritance over the last  years  of adults anticipate receiving an inheritance in the next  years  of the people who anticipate receiving an inheritance expect it to come from their parents or guardians while  anticipate it coming from a spouse Story continues Meanwhile the majority of people who anticipate an inheritance expect to receive cash Fortythree percent expect to receive owned property like a house and  anticipate receiving investments like stocks and bonds Nearly a quarter of people  who think they’ll receive an inheritance expect proceeds from a life insurance policy while  expect jewelry or other family heirlooms and  expect to inherit an annuity The top priorities for beneficiaries of these windfalls aren’t surprising The first use of the money is to pay off debt  followed by adding money to retirement savings  and preserving the inherited assets so that they can be passed down to the next generation  When it comes to retirement however  of adults say that they don’t have the support they need to navigate the financial challenges “The data show us that people continue to be focused on the basics — paying down debt building emergency savings and contributing to their retirement — but it can feel incredibly difficult to plan for longerterm goals like buying a home growing your family or retiring when daytoday challenges are occupying your time and attention” Schmitt added To help plan a tax efficient inheritance strategy talk to a financial advisor You can get matched with up to three fiduciary advisors for free Bottom Line Receiving any kind of financial windfall will challenge your

One Of America's Biggest REITs Is Seriously Strapped For Cash,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/one-americas-biggest-reits-seriously-190016688.html,2024-05-21T19:00:16Z,,finance.yahoo.com,One Of Americas Biggest REITs Is Seriously Strapped For Cash Starwood Capital Groups SREIT founded in  grew its overall value to an estimated  billion by early  However one of Americas biggest REITs is now firmly stuck between a rock and a hard place This year has been very difficult for SREIT which suddenly finds itself struggling for cash in a challenging real estate market characterized by higher borrowing costs fewer asset buyers and a massive influx of investor redemption requests The Wall Street Journal quoting various regulatory report filings reported that SREIT received  billion worth of investor redemption requests in the first quarter of  The same filing shows that SREIT has paid out less than  million of those requests This situation is similar to the one Blackstone REIT faced last year when it limited investor redemptions for several quarters in  Despite not having paid nearly twothirds of the first quarters redemption requests SREIT is still facing a severe cash crunch It has three main sources of liquidity cash a credit line and a portfolio of securities they could sell if they choose As recently as  SREITs total liquidity was  billion before shrinking by almost half to  billion by the end of  The current balance is only  million Dont Miss New fund backed by Jeff Bezos offers a  target yield with monthly dividends Heres how you can invest today Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible Not only are those numbers trending the wrong way but they are doing so at the worst possible time Its not unusual for investors to make redemption requests in a down market but the current state of the real estate market leaves SREIT with three equally unappealing options for easing its liquidity crisis The first option is to sell off assets from the portfolio Unfortunately its very much a buyers market right now because there simply arent a lot of buyers out there Very few institutional buyers would be interested in buying assets from SREIT at the top of the market prices especially considering current interest rates So any asset sale from SREIT at this point would likely require discounting prices which will only further decrease investor confidence in the fund The second option is also unpalatable SREIT could halt investor redemptions but most analysts think such a move would devastate its ability to raise funds in the future After all how does a REIT limit redemptions and then ask those same investors to provide more investment capital for future acquisitions a few years later Story continues Trending Become a real estate investor today  How to start small by mirroring BlackRocks big move SREITs management also understands that limiting redemptions would only be a temporary fix Thats because as soon as SREIT reauthorized redemptions it would find an even larger group of them requesting redemptions and heading for the exit doors with their capital That brings SREIT to their third and equally distasteful option for raising money borrowing Its one thing to borrow money to buy an asset and grow it in value However borrowing money to pay off redemption requests is the proverbial equivalent of robbing Peter to pay Paul Thats especially true considering that SREIT would likely need to borrow between  million and  billion to ease its liquidity crisis However todays skyhigh interest rates are as big an impediment to borrowing for REITs as they are for firsttime homebuyers The debt service on a loan that size at todays interest rates would be like a stone around SREITs neck constantly dragging the funds performance down with a giant line item that serves no real benefit from a wealthbuilding perspective Then there is the troublesome issue that SREITs current debttoasset ratio is already  Not only is that higher than many competing funds but borrowing more would push the ratio into the danger zone Industry analysts and real estate investors alike will be watching SREIT very carefully because the funds next move could have serious longterm implications for the future of REIT investing In the past investors could rely on big funds like SREIT to deliver reliable returns and relatively low risk If SREIT cant find a way out of its current troubles investor confidence in REITs could suffer severely Read Next Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession so its no surprise that people are turning to this Jeff Bezosbacked

Reserve the ECB and the Bank of England primarily to accompany the easing of inflation However the timing of the first cut remains uncertain as does the number of expected cuts Conditions for a first rate cut in June seem to be in place for the ECB which according to our forecasts would thus act before the Fed whose first rate cut is expected in July instead of June previously The possibility is rising that the Fed will not cut rates at all this year because of the resilience of growth and inflation Such a prolonged Fed monetary status quo could have more negative than positive consequences Until early April our expectations of policy rate cuts converged on a first synchronous move by the Federal Reserve the European Central Bank and the Bank of England in June depending on the meeting dates  for the ECB  for the Fed and  for the BoE Such a synchronicity though unsurprising was however uncertain given the higherthanexpected January and February  US inflation figures some desynchronization of business cycles and the uncertainty inherent in any forecast Developments during the week of  April led us to revise our Fed and ECB call and the BoE scenario may have to be adjusted too in the near future With US inflation as measured by the CPI surprising again on the upside in March we now expect only two rate cuts by the Fed this year the first one in July and the second one in December instead of three previously For the ECB we keep our forecast of a first rate cut in June but we have ruled out our backtoback cuts forecast ie June July and September favouring a more gradual easing of one cut per quarter in June September and December more in line with the ECB’s cautious stance so far Why cut policy rates For the United States the main argument for lower policy rates  to accompany lower inflation  is becoming more difficult to advocate owing to limited disinflation progress if at all The argument that the Fed could cut rates despite the current resilience of growth  on the grounds that this strength would primarily benefit from a noninflationary supplyside recovery supported by investment efforts productivity gains and an immigrationinduced boost to labour force  also seems to be weakened Monetary easing can however respond to more negative signs which are emerging in the labour market that put into perspective the robustness of nonfarm payrolls gains until March But these warning signs remain limited for now Looking ahead to  the US economy’s expected soft landing scenario which combines a return to potential growth and a continued slow decline in inflation to the  target does not require nor permit rapid rate cuts The situation in the euro area is different and the case for rate cuts from June onwards is more compelling True on an annual average basis we see Eurozone growth significantly increase between   and   while US growth would decrease also significantly  after  But Eurozone starting position is much less favourable than the US one The recovery remains to be confirmed on this side of the Atlantic while growth is stronger footed in the US In other words Eurozone growth needs support while US growth needs to be restrained ECB interest rate cuts would thus be helpful in this recovery process against a background of falling inflation These cuts would facilitate the necessary fiscal consolidation efforts too Italian Governor Piero Cipollone who recently joined the ECB Board also recently delivered a very dovish speech Instead of highlighting the inflationary fears linked to the combination of strong wage increases and weak productivity gains he warned of the risk of a too rapid slowdown in wages due to monetary policy being too restrictive for too long He points out that wages still have room for catching up and that their dynamism is one of the key factors in strengthening the nascent recovery in the euro area Without the economic recovery there will also be no cyclical rebound in productivity which is yet crucial in returning inflation to its  target All in all and as Christine Lagarde heralded it during her press conference early March the ECB knew a little more at its meeting on  April about the data conducive to starting its monetary easing cycle but not enough to act and cut It should have gathered enough information and therefore “know a lot more” by the next meeting on  June to make the first rate cut However according to our forecasts the economic conditions would allow only a very gradual easing of monetary policy It will be a matter of accompanying the recovery without triggering a rebound in inflation while the stickiness of some of its components prevent it from falling more significantly not to mention the possible inflationary effects of the recent tensions on oil and gas prices If it claims to be independent of the Fed the ECB cannot completely ignore another possible source of imported inflation if acting before and possibly with more cuts than the Fed led to a marked depreciation of the eurodollar What if the Fed does not cut at all While the conditions for the ECB to cut rates seem about to be achieved the possibility is rising that the Fed will not cut them at all  or even that it will have to raise them again  given the resilience of growth and inflation What could be the consequences On the one hand this could shake financial markets and economic agents whose current riskon mood and upturn in confidence are partly driven by rate cuts expectations If the latter were to be disappointed this could precipitate a correction in the financial markets and a business cycle downturn Existing vulnerabilities residential and commercial real estate markets business failures large debt refinancing needs delinquency rates on credit cards could expand and spread driving the economy into recession In a recent analysis the IMF highlights the wide diversity of situations across countries which could mitigate the risk of such a spillover And for the US in particular the good news is that the characteristics of its residential housing market and the evolution of these characteristics since the  financial crisis and the Covid shock suggest a weakening of this monetary policy transmission channel On the other hand a Fed’s monetary status quo would not necessarily be bad news if it is partly the result of the solid performance of the US economy if the real world is doing well it is a good sign for the financial world too On balance between the negative and the positive scenario it is difficult to assess which one would prevail but in our view the risks seem to be tilted to the downside To conclude if we go back to the ECB’s point of view in our scenario it would end up cutting rates before the Fed which would be noteworthy news and a wellfounded move according to our forecasts It should be noted that several emerging market central banks have already started cutting rates and that the Swiss National Bank SNB paved the way for developed country central banks in March The BoJ continues however to stand out from its peers starting only to embark on a process of monetary tightening As can be seen from the heatmap below showing policy rate changes since  after the “big tightening” in  when rate hikes were the rule the time for a synchronous “big easing” has not yet come Starting in  the rate cuts would remain scattered in  POLICY RATE CHANGES Article completed on  April

expect two cuts for the  dot plot to translate upwards which could be interpreted as a sign of an onset of latent pessimism Meanwhile Chair Powell called for a balanced assessment and even for people

see below and interest rates As a matter of fact private consumption and residential investment contracted over the last two quarters which together with the fall in public investment adversely affected growth Conversely the resurgence in foreign trade which was made possible thanks to a  qq rise in exports in Q  added  pp to the quarterly growth rate preventing the country from falling into a technical recession as a result According to our forecast Japanese GDP should contract slightly during the first quarter of   qq as a result of the earthquake on  January and disruptions to car

line with our expectations the Bank of Japan BoJ decided to raise its key rate the uncollateralized overnight call rate during its monetary policy meeting in March Therefore by raising the target

hitting its  target inflation rate in a smooth and sustainable manner these two tools have fulfilled their role These changes are occurring against a backdrop of a massive change in the inflation regime in Japan As a matter of fact the key measurement for core inflation excluding processed food hit an annual average of  in  and  in  thereby exceeding the inflation target raised from  to  in  for the first time since  a year that was already diverging from national inflation standards In addition the figure of  yy in January  was the highest since  Finally we revised our core inflation forecasts for the entirety of  upwards to  from  previously On the one hand this is the result of government decisions that are likely to raise energy inflation ie the upward revision of the leverage on renewable energy a contribution to the energy transition charged on electricity bills and the nonextension of subsidies for electricity and gas from the summer onwards On the other hand RENGO the Japanese Trade Union Confederation announced an average wage increase of  yy which exceeded expectations and was the largest rise for more than  years However at the same time such a rise may trigger and fuel inflation and inflation expectations This is in line with the BoJ’s objective for which a virtuous wageprice spiral must contribute towards achieving target inflation but may raise fears about inflation sticking above  Japanese monetary policy is expected to normalise very gradually once this first stage has passed The summary of the BoJ’s opinions following its March meeting includes the assertion that the economy is not currently in a situation that requires rapid interest rate hikes The end of negative interest rates is also not being presented as a transition to monetary tightening This echoes the statements made by Governor Kazuo Ueda following the BoJ meeting that financial conditions should remain accommodating for the time being Therefore we are expecting halfyearly hikes bringing the key rate up to  at the end of  and up to  at the end of  However the risks around this scenario are on the upside in view of the inflation forecasts and the current weakness of the yen As of  April  USDJPY parity stood at  compared to around  at the start of  and  at the start of  While this weakness in the yen is fuelling fears about imported inflation it has recently buoyed corporate profits In particular the currency has depreciated somewhat following the most recent monetary policy meeting which can be attributed to the BoJ’s stance on the need to

private consumption as well as public consumption Investments on the other hand suffered from the persisting negative business climate as the additional deterioration in business confidence index shows All in all a  quarter on quarter contraction of investment was observed in Q The main factors explaining this poor figure are most likely the elevated level of interest rates as well as the gloomy geopolitical context in which firms have a hard time making projections Inventories continue to be qualified as “too high” by many so reduction was once again the key word in the last  months of the year This also included a reduction in the storage of gas Looking forward we expect investment to contract further during  as higher financing costs will have a delayed negative effect on the

back of higher wages and lower inflation The labour market is expected to remain tight though a slight increase in the unemployment rate is expected Dutch households known to live on credit seem to have moderated this bad habit over time Expressed in percentage of GDP the households’ debt ratio fell from  in  to less than  at the end of last year Compared to neighboring countries this ratio

Dutch inflation to be around  and  a year later Real estate prices recover The Dutch housing sector has been particularly hit by the tighter monetary policy in Europe Prices fell by as much as  yy in May  but they are already recovering on hopes that interest rates have peaked and because mortgage rates already eased a bit In February  residential real estate prices were up by more than  on a yearonyear basis The main causes of the recent rise in prices are the large wage increases and the limited supply This fast recovery in the housing market is definitely another argument to explain the nice improvement seen on consumer confidence No government yet but things are moving When Geert Wilders secured the most votes in Dutch elections last year his victory was seen as a clear illustration

premiership as the price for joining a coalition government A few months away from the June th European elections the Dutch experiment underlines one of the enduring features of Europe’s fragmented democratic system winning votes is not winning power In the longer run once a government is formed there is a large consensus around the fact that public spending will increase granting more

Focused on the Future Think Tank at Wealth Management EDGE.",wealthmanagement.com,Many advisors are struggling to get firm executives to buy into the need for more diversity but making “the business case” can move Diversity Equity Inclusion  Belonging initiatives forward according to participants at Wealth Management EDGE’s think tank on DEIB issues in the industry “It’s definitely not a sprint it takes time” Aiysha Adams a vice president of Osaic said “But once you do that that is how you at least get your leadership by it if that’s the hard thing for your firm” Related Can The Wealth Management Industry Change Its Model To Reach a Diverse Client Base Adams was one of several presenters at the think tank “Focused on the Future Exploring DEIB in the Wealth Management Industry” The twohour discussion held during Wealth Management EDGE last week at The Diplomat Beach Resort in Hollywood Beach Fla included five presentations on particular DEIB initiatives at or outside of firms and a discussion with dozens of prominent individuals from across the industry Cary Carbonaro a senior vice president with ACM Wealth agreed with Adams recalling how she was able to convince Joe Duran to fund women’s leadership initiatives at United Capital Related The Power of Representation “I did a business plan for Joe Duran and he gave me millions of dollars for women’s leadership” she said “Not because it was the right thing to do but because it was a business case” The presentations included details about the SER Latin Advisor Summit which will hold its second annual conference Oct  in San Diego SER is hoping for  advisors this year three times last year’s number according to Ana Trujillo Limn a director of coaching and advisor content with Carson Group AdvoKate CEO and founder Kate Healy presented FinServ Foundation’s mentorship programs which help nextgeneration talent find easier paths into the profession The group currently has relationships with  universities and nearly  mentees Grant Rawdin also presented the ways his Pennsylvaniabased firm Wescott Financial Advisory Group emphasizes DEIB Diversitas’ programs for aspiring advisors began at the University of Akron and have expanded to approximately  colleges and universities around the country with four virtual programs a year according to Carina Diamond CEO and founder of Stella Secunda Partners Adams discussed the Financial Alliance for Racial Equality’s work at career fairs at historically black colleges and universities The organization aims to increase the number of black professionals in the financial services industry FARE includes  financial services firms including Osaic RBC Franklin Templeton and Nationwide and is currently partnered with five HBCUs The financial services industry has been slow to change in terms of diversity particularly at the leadership level According to a collection of research from the Government Accountability Office’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  of executiveseniorlevel management positions in the financial services industry were held by men compared to  for women  of those positions were held by white individuals compared to   and  for Black Hispanic and Asian individuals respectively While mentorship can help combat the low levels of diversity in the financial services industry more companies need to emphasize money according to Lindsey Lewis a senior director and chair at the American College of Financial Services Lewis said she heard from many in the industry that women “are over mentored but under sponsored” and firms need to be willing to write checks to ensure more people can participate in industry events including conferences like Wealth Management EDGE “Mentorship is very important but we need sponsorship” she said “What sponsorship means is writing that check and advocating for them when they’re not in the room” Adams noted advisors from diverse backgrounds may be inspired to bring more financial and retirement planning services to their own communities but with the relatively low revenue borne from commissions they can struggle to make that financial case Therefore it means advisors in that situation might need to attain greater success over years of work before doing so Adams also suggested that when building pipeline relationships with colleges and universities firms should look to community and twoyear colleges as opposed to focusing solely on fouryear universities But sometimes firms want diversity because their clients “want people that look like them” according to Allan Boomer a partner and chief investment officer with Momentum Partners Boomer cautioned this could lead some advisors to believe their only pathway to success is to land clients with similar backgrounds He hopes firms point to multiple paths to success not just the one “working with people who look like you” “That’s very limiting” he said “There are a lot of talented people that our industry is overlooking”

And they remain the best option for all but the most experienced investors.",wealthmanagement.com,Bloomberg Opinion  Retirement is expensive If you’re lucky yours will last a few decades and you’ll be earning no or very little income So if you want to have enough money when you retire you basically have three options Save more take more risk with your investments or work longer Many people find the first and third options undesirable or impossible That leaves the second option And despite what people such as Marc Rowan might lead you to believe there’s really no way to get a higher return without taking more risk Rowan the CEO of Apollo Global Management wants to allow Americans to invest more of their retirement money in private assets — credit and equity that aren’t sold in public markets The practice as he points out is allowed in Australia which is so pleased with its success that it plans to double its exposure to private equity in some accounts The UK is also considering increasing its exposure for its retirement savers In the US however only accredited read wealthy investors have direct access to such assets As Rowan sees it people invest for their retirement for the long term One reason private assets promise a higher return is they are less liquid If you give your money to a private equity fund it invests in assets that aren’t publicly traded so you can’t sell them if you need to After several years the fund matures and you get your money back with some return In theory at least you have been compensated for giving up liquidity with a higher return If you don’t need liquidity — like most retirement savers Rowan argues — you may as well get that illiquidity premium Rowan is correct that public assets aren’t as safe as many people think GameStop anyone and private assets aren’t as risky But that doesn’t mean private assets are safe — especially for inexperienced people investing for their retirement A comparable public asset is less risky not only because it is more liquid but also because it is more transparent It is subject to more regulatory scrutiny and carries a market price which conveys a lot of information about its present and future value and imposes more accountability on corporations It’s possible to argue that publicly sold assets are riskier because that market price is constantly updated making them prone to runs and bubbles see GameStop above Yes prices collapse — sometimes justifiably because the market overvalued an asset or a company or because some news changes the value of the asset In private markets these issues can be obfuscated for years There will eventually be a market reckoning but it will come much later Even the best private equity and credit managers are prone to groupthink and not seeing huge risks Private credit is presumed to be less risky for example because its less subject to runs and there is less duration risk But there is still credit risk because the interest rate is floating and that means more default risk especially in a risingrate environment Even the smartest people can be blind to big risks — and a market price on which a lot of smart people are making different bets that are transparent to everyone is the best insurance against groupthink Then there is the question of how investments in private assets would perform if expanded to the retail market They have performed well in the past but research suggests once public pensions started investing more in private assets the funds did less well Private markets seem to work better when they are smaller and fund managers can be more choosy Expanding their size and scope also can make markets riskier overall So far regulators are confident private credit does not pose much systemic risk — despite its opacity — but if the market grew bigger so would the systemic risks All this said Rowan is onto something when he talks about spending in retirement as opposed to saving for it There are a dearth of good products and strategies to help retirees spend their assets In  Apollo started Athene an insurance company that offers annuities The US annuity market which is still thin and does not offer much in terms of inflationlinked products is in desperate need of innovation and competition Athene’s annuities pay a fixed amount and the underlying assets are invested in private markets Depending on how well it is regulated and the fees involved this may be a good use of private markets in which many insurance companies invest already An insurance company is better poised than an average investor to take on risk and is on the hook if the assets don’t pay out Illiquidity premium or no when it comes to investing retirement assets in private markets the golden rule of finance still applies There is no extra reward without added risk More From Allison Schrager For more Bloomberg Opinion subscribe to our newsletter  To contact the author of this story Allison Schrager at email protected

the war for talent the number of k plans along will grow from just over  in  to just under  million in  according to Cerulli a  increase There was only a  increase the previous nine years leading to greater interest by wealth advisors who outnumber RPAs by  to  Personalization  Though crude target date funds were the first step within DC plans to personalize investments but it is a weigh station on the road to managed accounts with personalized TDFs a pit stop Many hurdles exist for managed accounts none of which are insurmountable including high fees as well as a lack of engagement and data As we attempt to provide inplan retirement income personalization is critical as is helping employees pick the right mix of available benefits If every participant is running their own defined benefit plan we need to personalize it for each person with frequent adjustments Technology  Participants and plan sponsors do not and will not compare products and services to industry standards they will compare it to Amazon and Venmo as well as other services we get in our personal lives And though no one knows how AI and ChatGPT will affect the DC industry few are doubting their potentially profound effect That puts pressure to better leverage access data while protecting plans and participants as well as providing protection against cybersecurity threats All of which along with the explosion of small plans has left the door open for fintechs like Guideline Betterment Vestwell Human Interest and most recently Go War for Talent and Convergence  Before the pandemic DC plans like healthcare were a tactical benefit with the focus on costs putting retirement plans way behind because most organizations did not pay for them directly That changed with the war for talent making retirement plans a strategic benefit used to recruit and retain talent leading to the convergence of wealth retirement and benefits at work Beyond fees funds and fiduciary as well as compliance plans are looking for partners to help employees with financial planning including student loans emergency savings HSAs nonqualified plans and debt management Government and Lawsuits  The rise of lawsuits will only continue as more money pours into DC plans and IRAs as will greater intervention of state and federal entities through laws like SECURE  the DOL fiduciary rule and state autoIRAs The Feds might not just require all employers including the gig economy to offer retirement benefits—they might nationalize the system if the private sector does not do a better job improving retirement income for more people Consolidation  With the stakes growing only a few record keepers RPA advisory firms asset managers and brokerdealers will have the capital and talent to compete and survive within the retirement plan ecosystem drawing in private equity money which will be even more demanding for results than the government So what does all this mean for the future of the DC industry Consolidation of traditional record keepers with only a handful that have scale and unique distribution surviving as well as fintechs likely to be gobbled up by current providers Winnowing of asset managers able to compete in the DC market unless they have one or more of the following tier one target dates indexing a major record keeper or distribution into the wealth advisor market RPAs not part of a larger shops will struggle to grow and compete leading to even more MA while at the same time wealth advisors with existing relationships with small business owners and managers will do more DC business through outsourcing while leveraging the convergence and PEPs Awakening of plan sponsors who will demand more from their advisors and providers resulting in greater consolidation and use of technology as well as demand for helping employees Eventually employees more engaged either on their own or through their advisor will put pressure not just on their employer and providers but the entire system raising existential questions about whether ks are the right vehicle Ready or not change is coming sometimes at what feels like lightning speed which at times seems impossible to keep up with or even

IRS Issues Proposed Foreign-Trust Regulations,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/high-net-worth/irs-issues-proposed-foreign-trust-regulations,"Fri, 17 May 2024 15:05:00 +0000",The agency seeks to prevent abusive tax schemes.,wealthmanagement.com,On May   the US Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued proposed regulations that provide guidance regarding information reporting of ownership transfers to and receipt of distributions from foreign trusts receipt of large foreign gifts and loans from and uses of property of foreign trusts The proposed regs also seek to amend the existing regulations relating to foreign trusts having one or more US beneficiaries Applicability The proposed regs affect US persons who engage in transactions with or are treated as the owners of foreign trusts and US persons who receive large gifts or bequests from foreign persons These regs should also interest taxpayers with an interest in a foreign retirement arrangement classified as a foreign trust for US purposes and those who receive gifts or bequests from nonUS foreign individuals Background As discussed in the IRS’ release abusive tax schemes including offshore schemes involving foreign trusts have reemerged in the United States after last peaking in the s In the s foreign trusts were used to transfer large amounts of assets offshore where it was much more difficult for the IRS to identify whether US persons owned an interest in such trusts and whether such persons were reporting and paying the required taxes on their income from such trusts Many foreign trusts were established in tax haven jurisdictions with bank secrecy laws which limited transparency into the holdings income earned or distributions made as there was previously no requirement for a US person to disclose distributions from foreign trusts Legislation changes and updates over the years have resulted in expanded reporting requirements for US taxpayers However these newly proposed regs provide some relief from these onerous foreign trust reporting requirements with a more substantial list of exceptions DualResident Taxpayers The proposed regs provide special rules for “dualresident taxpayers” A dualresident taxpayer is a nonUS individual who’s considered to be a resident of the United States and a resident of a treaty country income tax but due to the “tiebreaker” provision of the relevant treaty is treated as a nonresident alien for US income tax purposes Although dualresident taxpayers are generally treated as nonresident aliens for purposes of computing their US income tax liability they may be treated as US persons for certain international information reporting requirements such as Form  Annual Return To Report Transactions With Foreign Trusts and Receipt of Certain Foreign Gifts and Form A Annual Information Return of Foreign Trust With a US Owner Under the proposed regs dualresident taxpayers wouldn’t be treated as a US person for any portion of the year in which they’re treated as nonresident aliens for purposes of computing their US income tax liability As such there would be no international information reporting requirement for the dualresident taxpayer either Foreign Gifts Versus Loans Internal Revenue Code Section F requires US persons to disclose the receipt of large gifts from nonresident aliens or estates Currently the threshold for reporting these gifts is  Many taxpayers have attempted to avoid this reporting by arguing that the transfer is a loan not a gift To combat this nonreporting the proposed regs include an antiavoidance rule that would require gift treatment if all of the following requirements are met The IRS concludes that the amount received is in substance a gift based on the facts and circumstances The recipient doesn’t treat the amount received as a gift and The recipient doesn’t treat the amount received as taxable income In practicality these antiavoidance rules require the recipient to have informationdocumentation to substantiate the debit such as a loan agreement note or principalinterest payment history Reporting Threshold The proposed regs also update the  reporting threshold noted above The  threshold amount released in  Notice  Section VIB hasn’t been increased and isn’t currently indexed for inflation As such more gifts and bequests are required to be reported as inflation rises The proposed regulations would annually index for inflation the  threshold Itemization of Gifts Under the proposed regs if the aggregate amount of foreign gifts received exceeds the reporting threshold the US person would be required to separately identify each foreign gift of over  and provide identifying information about the transferor including their name and address It doesn’t appear that the  is to be annually adjusted for inflation The full extent of the identifying information isn’t provided in detail though the IRS feels that additional identifying information would assist in the determination of whether amounts received are property treated as gifts Currently identifying information of the transferor isn’t required to be disclosed on Form  Exceptions Foreign gifts received by IRC Section c charitable organizations are exempt from reporting as the entity itself is exempt from tax under Section a Foreign gifts received from transferors who relinquish US citizenship thereby becoming covered expatriates within the meaning of IRC Section Ag but whose amount doesn’t exceed the per donee exclusion in effect under IRC Section b are exempt from reporting Transfers to Foreign Trusts and Ownership Under the proposed regs a US transferor of property to a foreign trust will be considered the owner of the portion of the trust attributable to the property transferred during each tax year that the trust has a US beneficiary This proposed rule will apply regardless of whether the transferor retains any power under IRC Sections  through  Further the transferor must take into account all income deductions and credits attributable to the portion of the trust it owns when computing its tax liability Additionally a foreign trust that’s received property from a US transferor is treated as having a US beneficiary unless no part of the income or corpus of the trust may be paid or accumulated to or for the benefit of a US person If the trust is terminated at any time during the tax year no income or corpus of the trust could be paid to or for the benefit of a US person The regs provide for a very narrow exception persons who aren’t named as possible beneficiaries and aren’t members of a class of beneficiaries as defined in the trust won’t be taken into consideration if the transferor demonstrates to the satisfaction of the IRS that their contingent interest in the trust is so remote as to be negligible Finally the proposed regs provide that if a nonresident alien individual becomes a US person and has a residency starting date within five years after transferring property to a foreign trust the individual will be deemed to have transferred the property to the trust as of the residency starting date If an individual is deemed to have made a transfer the reporting requirements of IRC Section  will apply to the deemed transfer on the taxpayer’s residency starting date Loans by or Uses of Property for a Foreign Trust The proposed regs generally incorporate the guidance provided in Notice  with certain modifications with regard to IRC Section i The proposed regs provide that any loan of cash or marketable securities made from a foreign trust from principal or income is irrelevant directly or indirectly to a US grantor or beneficiary or any US person related to the US grantor or beneficiary is treated as a distribution under Section i as of the date the loan is made There are exceptions to this general rule—namely it won’t apply to Loans of cash in exchange or a qualified obligation within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section ibiii The use of trust property if the foreign trust receives the fair market value of such use within  days from the start of the use The de minimis use of trust property which is noted as being  days or less or Cash loans made by foreign corporations to a US beneficiary of a foreign trust to the extent that the aggregate amount of all loans doesn’t exceed the undistributed earnings and profits of the foreign corporation attributable to and included in the beneficiary’s gross income TaxFavored Foreign Retirement Trusts The proposed regs would expand upon the initial relief provided for “taxfavored foreign retirement trusts” by Revenue Procedure  for certain qualified foreign trusts In Rev Proc  the exemption only applied if the plan met certain criteria that is  contributions limits based on a percentage of the participant’s earned income subject to an annual limit The proposed regs expand on the initial relief provided in  by allowing limited contributions by unemployed individuals and requiring that the foreign trust meet either a new value threshold or a contribution limit For the value threshold the aggregate value of the trust is limited to no more than  during the taxable year as adjusted for inflation For the contribution limit contributions to the trust must either be limited by a percentage of earned income an annual limit of  or a lifetime limit of  million as adjusted for inflation Penalties The proposed regs under Section  provide for three separate civil penalties that may be assessed for each separate reporting requirement under Treas Regs Sections   and  They also provide that The penalty initially imposed for persons who fail to timely file a required notice or return or fail to provide complete and correct information is the greater of  or  of the applicable gross reportable amount defined in proposed Treas Regs Section c for each such failure The  is a substantial reduction from the  penalty currently imposed The US owner rather than the foreign trust must pay the penalty A Step in the Right Direction The proposed regulations provide clarity to a very complicated and complex area of international information reporting However limited in scope these proposed updates are they’re still a step in the right direction and expectations are that especially in the taxfavored foreign retirement trust space the broadening of exceptions will result in fewer filings The AICPA and other organizations continue to provide their feedback as practitioners feel broader exceptions are required as tax footprints continue to expand Additionally penalties in this space continue to be a muchdiscussed topic and I note that while reducing a  penalty to a  penalty is a great step in the right direction continued discussion and updates are still necessary Practitioners should continue to monitor these regs for updates and changes as they progress to finalization as well as continue to ask and educate clients about their foreign holdings
The Power of Representation,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/careers/power-representation,"Fri, 17 May 2024 14:58:00 +0000",How my journey led me to financial services.,wealthmanagement.com,I recently began my tenure as head of operations with the Financial Alliance for Racial Equity FARE and for the first time in my career I feel my experience talents and passion fully align with the organization I serve FARE has been operating as a nonprofit since September  with a mission to increase racial diversity drive greater equity and foster inclusion within the financial services industry and the communities they serve It’s a challenging assignment for such a young organization Yet we understand that disrupting the status quo in the world of finance to implement this vision with intention is necessary for greater diversity It’s fitting that my first few months coincided with Black History Month in February Women’s History Month in March and now April—Financial Literacy Month Each affinity group is a key part of who I am—a Black woman in finance Further these three months directly correlate to the intersectionality that lies at the core mission of what FARE seeks to address in the industry Related ESG and DEI Policies Were Always Luxury Goods Growing up in Ohio to workingclass bluecollar parents I didn’t necessarily see myself in the financial services space Let’s face it—there are not many Black and Brown faces in this field let alone Black and Brown women Not until recently have Black women like Mellody Hobson Lauren Simmons and even historical figures like Maggie Lena Walker been recognized for their work in the financial services industry The hard truth is that the financial services industry has never been diverse or inclusive When I entered the industry I was starved to see anyone who looked like me or even shared a similar background I spent those first years trying to find my place but as time went on I began to get my footing and make strides with the help of a few key support systems Related Why DEI Efforts Shouldn’t Slow Down in a Downturn While at Nationwide I learned of an associate resource group called African American Women Active and Ready to Exceed AWARE It was here that I met other Black women who would mentor me and help me find what I consider my heart and passion work Additionally the African American Leadership Academy was a critical network in my development As a Fellow the organization allowed me to grow and prepare to engage at the CSuite level which is critical to the work I do now for FARE Black and Brown people often don’t have access to these kinds of resources when attempting to enter finance I was one of the lucky ones who was able to tap into these networks Knowing this makes me even more determined to ensure that we provide mentorship through FARE Our inaugural HBCU Mentorship Program hosted  mentors and  mentees numbers we hope to build on in the future DEI Is Not The Devil FARE’s quest for greater diversity is not a new idea but remains necessary in today’s world With recent pushback against diversity equity and inclusion programs we are seeing many of the resources that had been in place for years dry up We believe that diversity in finance will be critical in addressing issues including the racial wealth gap strengthening our economy overall and fostering growth within our financial institutions Black and Brown people often don’t seek out financial literacy programs simply because they don’t see people who look like them working in the bank The painful history of Black and Brown people’s struggle to build and retain wealth has created deep distrust between them and financial institutions which to this day remains predominantly controlled by white men It’s obvious if we want greater investment from Black and Brown people we have to meet them where they are—with greater diversity The number of Black and Latino Certified Financial Planners has certainly increased in recent years but Black professionals only account for  of all CFPs With Black wealth projected to reach  trillion by  now is the time for the financial industry to invest in a more diverse workforce We want the financial institutions we work with to understand that diversity is not the devil and is actually good for their bottom line The CFP Board found companies with lower levels of racial diversity earn nearly  times less in revenue than those with high levels of racial diversity FARE is meeting this challenge by focusing our recruitment efforts on Black students and partnering with Historically Black Colleges and Universities HBCUs In addition to mentorship we have hosted educational summits and hired  interns and one fulltime associate in the past couple years Most importantly we are investing in a diverse future providing over  in scholarships to help Black professionals prepare for Certified Financial Planning CFP certification We are invested We know that true change only comes when you not only talk the talk but walk the walk And this is only the beginning What’s Next Moving forward FARE is taking bold steps to increase diversity in the financial services industry Recruiting investing sustaining and evolving culturally diverse groups of young people who will transform the industry is no small task—but we must and we will My journey to FARE has not been easy but I am clear about the resources networks and support systems that got me here I am here because of loving hardworking and supportive parents I am here because of mentorship I am here because of the opportunity and access to programs like FARE that nurtured me as a whole person  a Black woman in finance Now more than ever holistic spaces within financial services are desperately needed I want FARE to be the safe space for Black and brown young people interested in finance as they begin their career journey Additionally I want our partners and stakeholders to view the inclusion of diverse employees as an investment in the growth and sustainability of their company When this happens we all win I feel blessed to help lead FARE in this next chapter This divine alignment lets me know I am supposed to be here Not only do I have a seat at the table—this is my table Now the real work begins of bringing more people to what will be our tables Nicole Ridley is the Head of Operations at the Financial Alliance for Racial Equity FARE
AI vs. the Economy – A Tale of Two Outlooks,https://www.wealthmanagement.com/technology/ai-vs-economy-tale-two-outlooks,"Fri, 17 May 2024 05:14:00 +0000","Why Silicon Valley is confident, amid slowing economic growth.",wealthmanagement.com,Sponsored by By Todd Ahlsten CIO Parnassus Investments I’ve driven down to Silicon Valley countless times in my  years studying the semiconductor industry The severaldaylong trip I just finished where I sat down with CFOs and other executives of leading chip manufacturers was unlike any other I’ve experienced That’s because the AI boom that’s driving the semiconductor industry is unlike any cycle I’ve ever seen I recently wrote about the dynamics of chip cycles in which dramatic imbalances for chip demand and the capacity to produce them can cause bullwhiplike swings far more volatile than those in other industries The promise of and demand for AI computing is creating a cycle that’s very different from classic cycles for PCs memory chips and smartphones The demand drivers are exponential this time around based on accelerated computing and generative AI Driving the cycle are some of the most profitable and cashrich companies in the world Secondtier players and sovereign nations seeking to train AI models on local data are also looking to invest in this mega cycle The chip sector has been by far the best performer in the first quarter of  rising  And yet we may still be early in what looks like an elongated cycle When I looked into the eyes of the semiconductor CFOs I met I detected a high level of confidence in future demand What I took away from those meetings is that the current AIdriven cycle seems to have a secular durability although there will likely be plenty of volatility along the way Many are speculating that these elevated valuations are a sign of another tech bubble Unlike the dotcom bubble  years ago which had significant funding by startup capital and debtfueled investment against the promise of potential future growth this boom is largely being funded out of actual cashflow from deeppocketed tech incumbents such as Microsoft Meta and Oracle to name a few The accelerated computing required to run powerful AI models may drive demand well beyond the soughtafter graphics processing units GPUs from Nvidia and AMD It will also require central processing units CPUs to run servers in datacenters a new generation of highbandwidth memory chips and applicationspecific chips to run customized AI models at tech giants like Meta Google and Amazon No one can say for sure how the AI investment cycle will play out in the long run Many past semiconductor cycles have ended in hubris and overhyped trends But I think the secular dynamics of AI are going to be very powerful There is an exponential amount of computing power needed in processing data and in the training and inferencing of AI models before they can be monetized That could take years to build During my several days in Silicon Valley nobody talked about the economy Fed interest rates or cyclical factors AI is that much of a force of nature While I’ve learned a lot during eight economic cycles it’s also important to remain dynamic to always be learning and to evolve in the face of revolutionary change which accelerated computing promises to bring The Economy Beyond AI In most respects my overall outlook on the economy hasn’t changed much in the first quarter The economy so far this year has been pretty good—GDP is growing and the job market has been relatively strong But inflation remains stubbornly high and the mixed bag of effects that comes from higher interest rates continues to play out The question is how much does AI dominate the narrative I think the AI economy can continue to spur a massive wave of capital investment potentially creating conditions for a bubble But the real economy outside of AI will likely be pretty stagnant especially in the second or third quarters when GDP could slow down to near flat growth The next several months continue to hold some uncertainty The market is off to a strong start in the first quarter Yet I continue to see plenty of strong crosscurrents of potential economic headwinds that could whipsaw the market And I think that could happen if the lag effect of long and variable interest rates finally hits home and the labor market softens Positioning for Economic Resilience We believe the best way to navigate the type of economy and market we are seeing is by being very selective about the companies that earn a place in our concentrated portfolios Gaining exposure to AI through technology and semiconductors gives us the opportunity to grow as these companies expand their business driving the AI economy We look for quality companies with AI exposure trading at reasonable prices as well as widemoat durable and less economically sensitive companies outside What does that look like In our flagship Core Equity portfolio our top two holdings are Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL and we have semiconductor positions in Nvidia NVDA Applied Materials AMAT and Micron MU Other holdings  like Salesforce CRM Oracle ORCL Intuit INTU and Adobe ADBE  have a revenue sturdiness that we believe can remain resilient during a downturn Defensively we aim to protect against the potential economic slowdowns and uncertainties with economically resilient businesses that can outperform in this environment We seek opportunities in companies that offer high recurring revenue and durability in down markets such as autoparts retailer AutoZone AZO food distributor Sysco SYY discount retailer Costco COST paint manufacturer Sherwin Williams SHW and residential recycler Waste Management WM We think financial exchanges like CME Group CME and Intercontinental Exchange ICE can also do well during periods of volatility We also like solid life sciences companies such as Danaher DHR and Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO that not only offer steady revenue growth but service a lifescience industry that could experience a cyclical recovery While the prospect of a tech bubble certainly could be real the success these businesses have experienced is contributing to everwidening moats and sustained earnings growth that can continue to propel these stocks forward And on the other hand we are awaiting the pressure valve on the economy to release

residential consumers are getting their electricity from green energy sources, such as solar and wind.",search.cnbc.com,Wind turbines in Dawson Texas on Feb   Mark Felix  Afp  Getty Images As carbon emissions from fossil fuels keep warming the planet ecoconscious consumers may wonder if theres a way to buy electricity from renewable sources without installing technology like solar panels or windmills on their property In short the answer is yes However the option isnt necessarily available to all homeowners and renters It also often comes with a slight price premium experts said Few people are aware they can buy green energy Renewable energy sources — including wind solar hydropower geothermal and biomass — accounted for about  of US electricity generation in  according to the US Energy Information Administration Most or  of energy sources came from fossil fuels like coal natural gas and oil These energy sources release carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming The White House aims for electricity generation to be free of greenhouse gas emissions by  watch now A growing number of individuals and organizations are opting to shift away from fossil fuels About  million customers bought  Terawatt hours of renewable energy through voluntary green power markets in  according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Thats up fivefold from  TWh in  In the voluntary market customers buy renewable energy in amounts that exceed states minimum requirements from utility companies Over half of all US states have policies to raise the share of electricity sourced from renewables though most targets are years away Voluntary purchases accounted for  of the renewable energy market excluding hydropower as of  according to the Environmental Protection Agency They help increase overall demand for renewable electricity thereby driving change in the energy mix the EPA said Photovoltaic solar panels at the

too but more slowly Just one in six US adults know that they may have the option to buy renewable power either from their electric company or another provider according to the most recent NREL survey data on the topic published in  The market does continue to grow every year in terms of sales and customers said Jenny Sumner group manager of modeling and analysis at the NREL But very few people are aware that they can opt into green programs she said Its just not something thats top of mind for most people How consumers can buy green power Joe Raedle  Getty Images News  Getty Images Wind turbines in Solano County California on Aug   Loren ElliottBloomberg via Getty Images Power companies may offer whats known as green pricing programs Customers in these programs also known as utility green power programs pay their utility a small premium to get electricity from renewable sources according to the US Energy Department The cost generally exceeds that of a utilitys standard electricity service by about  to  cents per kilowatt hour Sumner said That may roughly translate to about  to  more per month Sumner said It will ultimately depend on factors like program price and household energy use she added Nearly half of Americans  said they were willing to pay more to get their electricity from  renewable sources according to a  poll by Yale Universitys Program on Climate Change Communication On average they said they would be willing to pay  more per month Green power marketing programs Consumers in some states can also opt into green power marketing programs Such states have competitive energy markets meaning consumers can choose from among many different companies to generate their power But unlike green pricing programs the company generating the renewable power may not be the customers utility which distributes the power According to the US Energy Department and the EPA residential green power options are available in these states with competitive or deregulated markets California Connecticut Delaware Illinois Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan New Hampshire New Jersey New York Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island Texas and Virginia These also tend to come with a premium though in some regions they may be price competitive with default electricity options the agencies wrote Community choice aggregation With community choice aggregation programs local governments buy power from an alternative green power supplier on behalf of their residents The municipality essentially operates as the supplier for the communitys electricity Sumner said These programs are especially prevalent in California she said Unlike the other program types residents generally dont have to opt into community choice programs its typically automatic and consumers can opt out if they wish Sumner said How renewable energy certificates work A solar farm in Imperial California on December   Valerie Macon  Afp  Getty Images Just because a consumer opts for renewable power doesnt mean the electricity being pumped into their home is coming from those renewable sources This may sound strange but it has to do with the physical nature of electricity and its movement through the shared electric grid Once the electrons have been injected into the grid theres no way of tagging that these are green electrons and these are not green said Joydeep Mitra head of the power system program at Michigan State University Nobody knows which electrons are going where watch now Green energy programs instead rely on renewable energy certificates or RECs The certificates are essentially an accounting mechanism for the generation and purchase of renewable energy Mitra said You may not be getting the green power but someone somewhere is And RECs keep track of it all Any consumer even one who doesnt have access to a green power program through their utility can also purchase a REC as a separate standalone product Its a way to provide extra funding to a renewable energy project typically sold by a broker or marketer rather than a utility Sumner said Buying these certificates separately doesnt impact a consumers existing utility service relationship How to

fell slightly in April as easing price pressures for groceries and other areas of consumer balance sheets were partially offset by higher gasoline prices and stubbornly high housing costs The consumer price index a key inflation gauge rose  in April from a year ago the US Labor Department reported Wednesday Thats down from  in March The report is consistent with inflation while still uncomfortably high slowly coming back to earth said Mark Zandi chief economist at Moodys Analytics The CPI gauges how fast prices are changing across the US economy It measures everything from fruits and vegetables to haircuts concert tickets and household appliances The April inflation reading is down significantly from its  pandemicera peak in  which was the highest level since  However it remains above policymakers longterm target around  The decrease in April marks progress in the inflationary fight which had somewhat flatlined in the first quarter of the year after falling consistently through much of  watch now The inflation trend line will determine how soon Federal Reserve officials start throttling back interest rates which influence borrowing costs for consumers and businesses After

increased  in the month from March to April a rise from  the prior month the Bureau of Labor Statistics said You saw prices at the pump rise again in April said Michael Pugliese a senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics Average US gasoline prices jumped about  cents in April to  a gallon as of April  according to weekly data published by the US Energy Information Administration That increase is largely due to dynamics in the market for crude oil which is refined into gasoline economists said Higher fuel prices can filter through to many other areas of the economy since they factor into transportation and distribution costs for goods for example Gas prices have since retreated a bit to  per gallon as of May  according to the EIA Among other consumer staples grocery prices decreased by  from March to April meaning they deflated rather than inflated according to the CPI data Food at home prices rose  in the past year Food inflation has basically gone to zero Zandi said I think thats really important for most American families not only for their own financial situation but because of how they perceive the economy Progress on housing has been slow Economists generally like to

quickly as expected Its one of the reasons weve seen slow progress in the inflation fight said Stephen Brown deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics Shelter and gasoline inflation combined contributed more than  of the monthly CPI increase for all items according to the BLS Other notable areas in core inflation over the past year include motor vehicle insurance prices are up  personal care  medical care  and recreation  Meanwhile other consumer categories have seen improvement For example prices for new and used vehicles decreased  and  in the past year respectively Those lower costs should filter through to help motor vehicle insurance inflation fall too economists said Supply and demand imbalances At a high level imbalances in supply and demand are what trigger

fresh attention is a trend investors may not want to miss Heat pumps The devices are seen as a critical tool to achieve global netzero targets particularly as temperatures continue to rise Making the switch will also benefit consumers wallets and punch up the value of several energyintensive areas in the market ranging from real estate to industrials While it hasnt turned into a huge cash driver just yet its heading in the right direction analysts say Heat pumps are continuing to gain market share within the broader heating ventilation and air conditioning industry according to UBS outselling gas furnaces in the US for the first time last year Recent trends such as the push for the decarbonization and electrification of heat economic factors and government support through regulation and incentives mean that the market for industrial heat pumps is set to skyrocket with expected growth of more than  percent per annum until  McKinsey analysts wrote in a recent report Early market entry is key for success in this race Heat pumps provide both air conditioning and heat — all in one device Theyre also three to five times more efficient than conventional heating systems Using electricity these devices transfer heat from lowertemperature space to a highertemperature one essentially absorbing free heat rather than generating heat like Barclays analyst William Thompson said When theyre powered by renewable energy sources they decarbonize industrial heating space and water he added Environmentally sustainable and energy efficient heat pumps could optimize energyintensive operations in areas like data centers They also could lower costs for a majority of households and increase the value of the property where the units are installed Increasing adoption of heat pump technology is being made by companies across several industries including industrials chemicals real estate paper and packaging and food and beverage Its a solution that is getting more attention in a rush to achieve climate goals In order to keep global average surface warming at a level of no more than  degrees Celsius as called for in the Paris Agreement  the United Nations has a target of reducing worldwide carbon emissions by  by  and reaching netzero by  Progress isnt moving as fast as it should be however the UN said UBS strategist Amantia Muhedini estimates heat pumps could slash global CO emissions by at least  million tons through  while the International Energy Agency predicts their use could trim global building space and water heating emissions by roughly  by  With almost half of global energy demand stemming from heating and cooling more efficient HVAC solutions will be a crucial enabler of decarbonization Heat pumps could play a viable role in this regard Muhedini said in a research note last week Who stands to benefit Industrial stocks — namely the major heat pump manufacturers — are perhaps the most salient investing opportunity HPs are disrupting the heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC industry Barclays Thompson wrote in a recent note to clients In our view HP manufacturers with established installer networks have a key competitive advantage since installers can face high switching costs when dealing with new suppliers learning new HP systems and facing reputation risk from poor HP installations Potential beneficiaries include heat pump makers Carrier  Trane  Johnson Controls and Lennox  according to Barclays Carrier shares have jumped about  this year but analysts think the stock could be slightly overvalued expecting shares could decline about  per FactSets consensus estimates The company earlier this year completed its acquisition of German heat pump company Viessmann Climate Solutions a sign that the somewhat fragmented HP industry seems to be in the early stages of consolidation Thompson said It plans to divest even more of its nonHVAC businesses this year Many analysts confidence in Carrier was boosted after its firstquarter beat earlier this month Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann on May  lifted his price target on buyrated Carrier by  to  implying  potential upside He anticipates solid midtosingledigit growth for several years coupled with earnings growth ahead of its peers Trane another leading heat pump manufacturer has seen its share price balloon by more than  this year Analysts surveyed by FactSet have a consensus  price target on the stock which implies just  potential upside But like Carrier Trane recently boasted solid firstquarter results supporting analysts bullish sentiment on the stock Strong Q beat and raised  guidance we think indicate that TT continues to capitalize on relatively healthy endmarket trends particularly in commercial HVAC and is delivering solid operational performance across margin and free cash flow generation which in our view should support solid multiyear earnings growth and drive consistent shareholder value said Citi Researchs Andrew Kaplowitz He kept his buy rating and increased his price target by  to  suggesting shares could gain  from the stocks latest close Trane on Wednesday announced its participation in the US Department of Energys Commercial Building Heat Pump Technology Challenge  an initiative through which the company will develop new lowemissions heat pump rooftop units in an effort to help organizations meet their energy efficiency needs and decarbonization goals According to the DOE rooftop heat pumps can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy costs by as much as  compared with conventional rooftop units using natural gas heating The DOE also runs a Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge  which is partnered with Trane Carrier and Johnson Controls among other leading heat pump makers While Johnson Controls is another leading heat pump manufacturer UBS downgraded the stock over what it sees as a lack of positive catalysts ahead UBS expects the company will have difficulty hitting its  forecast Earlier this year RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray noted a decline in Johnson Controls HVAC shipments throughout  driven by softness in residential markets amid higher mortgage rates and price inflation Dray rates the stock underperform due to expected lukewarm earnings growth and margin risk Dray prefers Carrier which has a business thats evenly split between residential and commercial markets Johnson Controls has a high nonresidential exposure of roughly  while Trane is at  and Lennox at  according to Dray Beyond manufacturers Heat pump adoption also could create knockon opportunites according to Barclays Companies like Rockwell Automation  an industrial automation technology provider and manufacturing company Owens Corning could be beneficiaries of building upgrades — like the use of more energy efficient windows and insulation — that are needed to improve insulation and heating distribution to accommodate heat pumps Owens posted a significant earnings and revenue beat in late April leading UBS to hike its price target by  to  suggesting shares could climb more than  from Mondays close The stock has added nearly  this year In the chemicals sector companies that produce more ecofriendly refrigerants for heat pumps could one day reap the benefits of recent legislation in the US that will ban next year the production of heat pumps that use refrigerants with high levels of global warming potential Companies developing or creating alternatives include Honeywell International  Chemours and Arkema  Barclays said Hurdles to adoption Several barriers for heat pump installation continue to plague its progress — such as a shortage of trained workers high installation costs and supply constraints Its also important to note that while heat pumps can be much more efficient and costfriendly than conventional heating they generally dont offer fuel savings relative to natural gas heating given the high ratio of gastoelectricity prices in many countries per Barclays Major companies are setting an example by putting a spotlight on how theyve been able to integrate heat pumps into their operations According to the IEA heat pumps could prove suitable to serve nearly  of industrial heating demand by  mostly in the paper and packing food and beverage and chemical industries For example Unilever said in June  that In our operations thermal energy use accounts for most of our carbon footprint  to meet our target of achieving  renewable heat by  we will be looking to significantly increase our use of heat pumps across our operations Nestle said a year ago that the company replaced the use of fossil fuels with industrial heat pumps in its plants in Spain and Switzerland reducing tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year UBS Muhedini recently wrote that heat pump sales growth is looking optimistic for this year She said heat pump sales rose  in  following more than  growth in  Although  sales growth was negative we conclude that this is due to the overall HVAC industry where gas furnaces had an even steeper decline she said adding that governments around the world are incentivizing adoption through tax credits rebates and grants

back to life this year, despite an environment of higher-for-longer interest rates that raises their borrowing costs.",search.cnbc.com,These are not your grandparents powerandlight utility companies The sector has come roaring back to life this year defying an environment of higherforlonger interest rates that would normally act as a headwind by raising the capitalintensive companies borrowing costs Utilities as a group are up  over the past three months far outpacing the broader S  P  as well as even technology stocks Vistra Corp has doubled over that period while Constellation Energy is up nearly  and NextEra Energy has surged  This is not your old utility where you just get a dividend and youre happy Shahriar Pourreza senior managing director and equity analyst who covers power and utilities at Guggenheim Securities told CNBC This is the strongest fundamental environment for the utilities base that I have seen in over  years Pourreza said The recent rally in utilities has been driven by a shifting narrative away from interest rates and toward future growth catalysts according to Pourreza Its a major comeback for a sector that dropped more than  in  versus the S  P  which soared  That was due in large part to headwinds from repeated interest rate hikes Utilities are particularly sensitive to higher rates because theyre such a capitalintensive business The sector was oversold coming into  with the market going too far in pricing in the impact of interest rates Pourreza said While the Federal Reserve has been in no hurry to cut rates this year as stubborn inflation stays above  Chair Jerome Powell has indicated that future hikes are unlikely Futures traders are expecting rate cuts to start in either September or December Investors are increasingly looking to the future and the pivotal role utilities will play in meeting electricity demand from data centers the use of artificial intelligence reindustrialization and robust residential power consumption as workers continue to use their homes as offices in the wake of the pandemic Energy transition supercycle Electricity demand in the US could increase as much as  by  according to a Wells Fargo research note from April Data centers are expected to consume  of total US power demand by the end of the decade more than double their current rate according to a Goldman Sachs report last month The growing electricity load and the need to strengthen and decarbonize the grid requires much higher levels of capital spending Pourreza said Utilities are surging from  to  growth to rates of  to  or higher he said Thats a huge acceleration of growth and its just scratching the surface Pourreza said The high levels of growth combined with yields of  to  means utilities could see  to  annual returns he said Stephanie Link chief investment strategist with HighTower Advisors described the current environment as an energy transition supercycle with  trillion in spending needed between now and  on infrastructure and technology related to clean power the grid data centers and AI The other reason utilities have done well is because actually earnings have come in much better than expected up  year over year Link told CNBCs  Closing Bell Overtime  last week I think that picked up the attention of a few investors as well The rally in the utility sector is being driven by a subset of companies that are benefiting the most from data center hyperscalers and the demand for electricity while traditional integrated power companies are not performing as well said Paul Hickey at Bespoke Investment Group Constellation NextEra Vistra The best way to play the data center angle is through utilities that have deregulated assets such as Constellation NextEra and Vistra Pourreza said Power companies with deregulated assets are able to respond to market conditions more quickly than traditional utilities he said Constellation NextEra and Vistra have rallied largely due to their exposure to the data growth trend the analyst said Constellation and Vistra operate deregulated nuclear plants and investors are starting to price in opportunities for tech companies like Amazon s Web Services division Alphabet s Google unit and Microsoft to contract directly with these assets for power according to Pourreza The tech sector is looking for clean energy to power data centers as they are simultaneously trying to limit their carbon footprints There are huge opportunities for data centers to contract directly with a nuclear plant because its  power and its clean Pourreza said NextEra for its part has deregulated renewable assets such solar plus battery storage that are attractive to the hyperscalers according to Pourreza As the utilities get more leverage to different themes in the market  including data centers domestic manufacturing ESG movement  youre going to see a wider base of investors to look at this space Pourreza said

Like its past two earnings sell-offs, we think investors should buy the dip.",search.cnbc.com,Another earnings report another selloff in extended trading for Palo Alto Networks  But like the two releases preceding Monday nights results were looking at the decline as buying opportunity for longterm investors Revenue during the cybersecurity companys fiscal  third quarter increased  year over year to  billion beating the consensus estimate of  billion that was compiled by LSEG Adjusted earnings per share grew  to  in the three months ended April  ahead of estimates of  per share LSEG data showed Total billings increased a meager  year over year to  billion missing estimates of  billion according to FactSet However Palo Altos remaining performance obligation RPO accelerated to a  yearoveryear growth rate up from a  rate in the prior quarter Palo Alto Networks Why we own it We believe cybersecurity is a secular growth market as bad actors are relentless and companies simply cannot afford to not invest in defense It is a neverending arms race We believe Palo Alto Networks in particular is uniquely positioned to win due to its bestinclass tools and broad product portfolio that allows it to provide an allencompassing platform solution to cybersecurity Competitors CrowdStrike Fortinet Cisco Systems Last buy April   Initiation Feb   Bottom line This was a strong quarter from Palo Alto Networks despite what the stock reaction might suggest And were ultimately inclined to view the stocks pullback as a buying opportunity — just like we did in November and then again February  While billings trends are not what Wall Street wants to see the question for investors is this Do you buy into CEO Nikesh Aroras view that billings is not as meaningful a metric as it once was and instead our focus should be on remaining performance obligation trends Its a key question bulls and bears are sure to battle over because billings slowed materially while RPO showed a sequential acceleration In our view Auroras reasoning is sound Billings represent the total amount of dollars actually invoiced in a given period RPO represents the total value contracted during the quarter Understandably investors prefer billings because its more concrete After all things like churn and cancellations are risks to a company actually realizing its RPO as revenue down the line The problem with billings right now is the cost of money — thanks to the highest federal funds rate in two decades — which is leading to increased negotiations on billings terms and financing options As a result we understand managements desire to deemphasize billings and instead focus on RPO We cant dismiss the billings dynamic entirely but we are highly encouraged by the slight uptick in RPO growth It should also be noted that management actually added to its billing backlog in the third quarter an indication of strong demand despite some noisiness in the reported figure Against this backdrop managements forward guidance also looks good with fourthquarter revenue and earnings projected to match expectations Its outlook for billings is a tad bit light but again wed argue results — and guidance — for this metric need to be taken with a grain of salt in this highrate world Thats especially true given the divergence between billings and RPO On the earnings call Arora offered a favorable update on the companys decision to accelerate its platformization strategy which tanked the stock  in a single session following its February earnings report  Essentially management is offering concessions to customers that used multiple cybersecurity vendors to get them to migrate over to Palo Altos platforms The company decided to take some shortterm pain in hopes of securing longterm gain with growth accelerating once the more promotional period is behind it Im delighted to report despite the concerns around our platformization approach after our last quarter the customer feedback has been nothing but encouraging We have initiated way more conversations in our platformization than we expected Arora said If meetings were a measure of outcome they have gone up  and a majority of them have been centered on platform opportunities In short demand is robust and my expectation is that we will continue to see it be that way over the next many quarters These comments from Arora figure into our opportunistic view on the stocks slide in extended trading What we heard on the call is highly encouraging billings weakness aside The company is signing large longterm deals and customers are taking to the idea of — and clearly understanding the need for — platformization especially with bad actors now leveraging the power of artificial intelligence On the call management highlighted several deals in which Palo Alto displaced the competition not only because of its bestinclass solutions but also because of its ability to actually offer a platform strategy rather than piecemeal solutions Arora also offered a bullish update on Palo Altos work with UnitedHealth in response to the disruptive cyberattack at its Change Healthcare subsidiary though he didnt name the company directly A large health care company experienced a breach and engaged our Unit  incident response services After we helped the customer remediate and get back online we were able to educate the customer on the benefits of platformization Arora said The customer fully platformized with us standardizing our network security Prisma Cloud and Cortex This transaction was the largest in the history of Palo Alto Networks at nearly  million of total contract value In general we have no doubt that cybersecurity is a secular growth market that will remain in demand and at the company level we think Palo Alto Networks has both the tools to address customer needs and a good strategy in place to ensure they remain a top player for years to come With management noting platformization conversations are materializing faster than expected we arent overly concerned about Mondays night stock move and see longerterm upside ahead At the same time we recognize Wall Streets current focus on billings Thats why were keeping our  rating on Palo Alto as we look for shares to stabilize before stepping in to repurchase the stock we sold higher last week ahead of the report  We made the sale out of discipline because the stock had climbed more than  over a roughly sixweek period prior to the trade Its another reason why were able to look at the selloff through a buyers lens Guidance For its fiscal  fourth quarter the company expects all estimates are sourced from FactSet Total billings in the range of  billion and  billion a slight beat at the midpoint versus estimates of  billion Total revenue of  billion to  billion which at the midpoint is in line with the estimate of  billion NonGAAP earnings per share are expected in the range of  to  in line with estimates of  at the

store in Manhattan New York City February   Under Armour announced a broad restructuring plan on Thursday as it said sales in its largest market North America plunged  and predicted the trend will get worse throughout its current fiscal year The athletic apparel retailer also saw profits sink by more than  during its fiscal fourth quarter compared with the yearago period Its unclear how many employees Under Armour will lay off as part of the restructuring but the plan is expected to cost between  million and  million a portion of which will be used for employee severance and benefits costs The company declined to share more information with CNBC about its restructuring The companys shares initially plunged double digits in premarket trading after its earnings report was released but later rebounded after its earnings call with Wall Street analysts Shares closed more than  lower Heres how the athletic apparel retailer did in its fiscal fourth quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share  cents adjusted vs  cents expected  cents adjusted vs  cents expected Revenue  billion vs  billion expected The companys reported net income for the threemonth period that ended March  was  million or  cents per share compared with  million or  cents per share a year earlier Excluding onetime items the company reported earnings of  cents per share Sales dropped to  billion down about  from  billion a year earlier During the quarter sales in North America declined  to  million worse than the  million that analysts had expected according to StreetAccount Under Armour said it expects sales to continue to worsen in North America The company anticipates they will drop between  and  in its current fiscal year Due to a confluence of factors including lower wholesale channel demand and inconsistent execution across our business we are seizing this critical moment to make proactive decisions to build a premium positioning for our brand which will pressure our top and bottom line in the near term founder and CEO Kevin Plank said in a statement Over the next  months there is a significant opportunity to reconstitute Under Armours brand strength through achieving more by doing less and focusing on our core fundamentals he added Across Under Armours business the company is expecting revenue to be down at a lowdoubledigit percentage rate in its current fiscal year while analysts had expected sales to grow by  according to LSEG The company is planning to cut down on promotions and discounting which it expects will lead its gross margin to rise between  and  percentage point for the fiscal year Its expecting diluted earnings per share to be between  cents and  cents and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between  cents and  cents for the year Analysts had expected earnings per share of  cents according to LSEG Under Armours rough quarter comes about two months after the retailer announced former Marriott executive Stephanie Linnartz would be stepping down from her role as CEO after barely a year on the job and Plank would once again take the helm of the company he founded in  Linnartz was the second CEO the company has cycled through in less than two years During a call with analysts Plank was blunt about where things had gone wrong for Under Armour He pointed to inconsistent leadership as one of the primary issues With several CEOs and heads of products marketing and North America over the past half decade ongoing turnover of critical leadership has been central to our inability to stay agile and decisive said Plank Linnartz was hired on a bet that her experience building out Marriotts renowned Bonvoy loyalty program and driving digital revenue for the hotel giant would offset her lack of experience in the retail industry Before her departure she managed to overhaul Under Armours Csuite and build out its loyalty program She was attempting to pivot the brands assortment to a more athleisurefocused offering that had more stylish options for women who tend to spend more on clothes and shoes than men do Now Plank is looking to undo some of that work He told analysts that the company had taken our eyes off its core mens apparel business which has significantly impacted the brands perception and led it to become more promotional and commoditized We will rectify this said Plank This focus does not mean that we are deprioritizing our footwear or womens business per se but from a sequencing perspective mens apparel will be our highest priority As Plank tries to reset the business he said Under Armour plans to reduce its style counts by roughly  over the next  months and cut down the amount of time it takes to get a product from an idea to a showroom floor He aims to streamline the process so itll only take between  and months instead of the  months it currently takes — a system he called just plain uncompetitive in the  landscape The full restructuring will focus on streamlining Under Armours overall business reducing silos and ensuring that every staffers work is directly contributing to its primary goal Selling

brought promising news for Walmart and other retailers Inflation eased in April according to the Labor Department data released Wednesday The consumer price index was up  year over year The closely watched number tracks how much goods and services cost at the cash register Walmart saw some signs of easing too On the companys earnings call CEO Doug McMillon said inflation in the US was only up  for the quarter with midsingle digit deflation on general merchandise and lowsingle digit inflation in food He said the company has increased rollbacks price reductions on specific items that it typically advertises on its website or with signs in its stores Even so the discounter has noticed the impact of inflation as its shoppers have been selective with purchases Rainey said customers wallets are still stretched He said shoppers have bought less general merchandise such as home goods and electronics as they prioritize spending on food and healthrelated items a trend that the company has seen for the past several quarters Still even the lowincome consumer seems to be holding in there pretty well Rainey said He added that sales even in general merchandise categories improved year over year Walmart had a weaker sales month in April which mirrored retail sales numbers released by the Commerce Department on Wednesday but that was offset by sales trends in the other months of the quarter Rainey chalked up a weaker April to Easter shifting into March along with cooler and rainier weather He said sales have picked up again in May and looked similar to the average of the fiscal first quarter On the earnings call McMillon emphasized Walmarts expansion of its online business and success getting more customers to buy other items besides groceries Groceries drive most of Walmarts business — accounting for nearly  of the companys US sales in the most recent full fiscal year — but arent as profitable as selling items like clothing or makeup We punched below our weight on general merchandise specifically in apparel and home for a really long time maybe forever and I think the progress were seeing right now is driven by the instore remodels and ecommerce McMillon said As Walmart tries to appeal to younger and more affluent households it recently launched a new privatelabel grocery brand which includes bolder flavors plantbased items and more It is also upgrading and modernizing more than  stores across the country The renovated stores showcase some of the retailers newer and more fashionforward brands like Love  Sports an activewear brand

after a brutal earnings selloff in February and Wall Street analysts say the cybersecurity companys earnings next week will justify its resurgence Shares of Palo Alto plunged  on Feb  a session after the company delivered a more cautious outlook for the rest of  The stock then seesawed for more than a month until shares bottomed out at  apiece on April  At the top of investors worries Softness in the US federal government market along with the financial impact of ramping up its platformization strategy to bundle services and products However Palo Altos stock has since advanced  outperforming the iShares Cybersecurity and Tech ETF s  decline over the same period There are three reasons that investor sentiment will continue to improve into the May  earnings release and beyond according to recent research notes from Barclays and Morgan Stanley  History unlikely to repeat itself Sellers came out in full force after CEO Nikesh Arora announced a pivot to accelerate platformization during the February conference call The shift in business strategy requires Palo Alto to give customers its new services and products for free to demonstrate their many benefits This in turn would impact billings and revenue growth over the next  to  months Palo Alto argued that nearterm headwinds would pay off down the road with larger deals as customers look for a onestop shop for their cybersecurity offerings The company in February lowered its fiscal  total billings guidance to a range of  billion to  billion Prior guidance was  billion to  billion Its new outlook was below Wall Street analysts estimates at the time of  billion Meanwhile Palo Alto delivered a total revenue outlook of  billion to  billion for fiscal  lower than the companys previous guidance of  to  billion Analysts expectations were  billion as well But Barclays analysts said these discounted offerings shouldnt impact the companys threemonth financial performance This is the first quarter where PANW is scaling its free trials and platformization strategy but we havent picked up any meaningful gotomarket strategy changes in our checks quite yet so the headwind to billings from free trials may be smaller than expected the analysts wrote in a May  note Plus given that management has already lowered Palo Alto Networks guidance for the rest of  analysts say billing estimates for the upcoming print are derisked This means figures were so conservative last quarter that investors believe the odds of further downside are low Not only may this circumvent another huge decline in the stock price after results but it gives management ample room to beat expectations During Palo Altos postearnings call were eager to learn more about how Aroras bet on platformization is playing out including

busy grabbing more market share according to analysts PANW continues to gain share across multiple security categories as enterprises adopt the broader platform Morgan Stanley analysts wrote Meanwhile Barclays said platformization is happening but not because of free trials — just good old fashioned crossselling and competitiveness Palo Alto Networks has nabbed a series of large deals Our favorite cybersecurity name and portfolio stock was tapped to help UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Change Healthcare after a massive attack in February caused huge disruptions throughout the US healthcare system In a recent interview with CEO Arora Jim Cramer said that Change Healthcare brought Palo Alto in because they understood how to fix it praising the company for its track record of offering effective cybersecurity solutions over its competitors Arora has long said that Palo Altos move to platformization will secure its lead among peers as the industry consolidates spending If you have    cybersecurity vendors deployed in your infrastructure you need the data from all of them CEO Arora said on Mad Money  last week You need to be able to analyze it on the fly The Club took a similar hopeful stance back when shareholders panic sold the stock after earnings Weve held out on the view that shortterm pain is worth the longterm gains and even bought up shares of Palo Alto twice since

Cybersecurity remains a relative bright spot as rising threats and new regulatory requirements drive greater Clevel priority Morgan Stanley analysts wrote nudging at the Securities and Exchange Commissions more stringent disclosure rule s for publiclytraded US companies US federal spending looks better than it did last quarter as well improving demand for cybersecurity offerings broadly Barclays said citing peer commentary Tenable management for example previously issued upbeat remarks regarding spend during a May  conference call with CFO Stephen Vintz describing the federal pipeline as strong For its part Palo Alto said that the company had several projects with the federal government that did not close in the previous quarter All in all we feel good about the Q setup on billings annual recurring revenue and free cash flow based on the bar our own checks and activity in the US Fed market  we still think PANW needs to rebuild investor confidence with at least another quarter of consistent performance but we think this Q could start that process Barclays analysts wrote The Club is focused on how much industry spend is going to Palo Alto versus competitors but were not concerned about demand for the companys offerings Im a big believer in Palo Alto because the demand in cyber protection is endless especially now that the hackers have access to AI and this

earnings as it tries to grow sales with home professionals in a tough housing market.,search.cnbc.com,The home improvement customer is extremely healthy from a financial perspective he said And so its not the case of not having the ability to spend What they tell us is theyre just simply deferring these projects as given higher rates it just doesnt seem the right moment to execute In an interview with CNBC Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said customers are in a waiting game that began in the second half of last year as they responded to mortgage rates climbing He said the company anticipated those trends would continue Still the home improvement retailer reaffirmed its fullyear guidance which includes an additional week from the prior year It said it expects total sales to grow about  in fiscal  including those extra days However the retailer said it anticipates comparable sales which take out the impact of store openings and closures to decline about  excluding that additional week Home Depot on Tuesday posted quarterly revenue below Wall Streets expectations as shoppers postponed bigger discretionary projects like bath and kitchen remodels because of higher interest rates and made spring purchases late The logo of US home improvement chain Home Depot is seen in Mexico City Mexico on Jan   Heres what the company reported for the threemonth period that

and declined  in the US Home Depot is contending with a tougher housing backdrop which has dampened demand for doityourself projects About half of Home Depots sales come from DIY customers and the other half come from pros like roofers and landscapers As interest rates remain high consumers have been reluctant to move out of their homes and into new ones — the kind of turnover that often inspires home projects Higher interest rates have also dinged the desire for largerscale projects that can require financing For the past several quarters Home Depot has seen customers buy fewer bigticket items and take on more modest projects  a trend that persisted in the most recent quarter In the fiscal first quarter customers made fewer visits to Home Depots stores and website and tended to spend less when they did Customer transactions declined  to  million and average ticket fell  to  Home Depot has seen sales moderate after more than two years of explosive demand during the Covid pandemic The company posted its worst revenue miss in nearly two decades and cut its forecast in the yearago first quarter Home Depots sales totaled  billion in the fiscal year that ended in late January a drop of  from the previous year Inflation may also be playing a role in that pullback as consumers spend more money on essentials and have to make tradeoffs when spending discretionary income However McPhail said Home Depot is not seeing customers trade down to cheaper items like less expensive power tools or appliances He pinned the companys softer sales in large part on consumers deferral mindset and a housing market that has slowed dramatically When we have seen mortgage rates decrease slightly as we saw at the beginning of this quarter the housing turnover seems to respond quickly and sharply in a positive direction he said And so we think thats an indicator that there is a tremendous amount of pentup demand for household formation and housing turnover and the larger projects that are associated with housing turnover Weather pressured sales too in the recent quarter he said Spring is the biggest sales season for home improvement retailers including Home Depot Yet customers delayed outdoor purchases because of colder and wetter weather in many parts of the country he said Those spring purchases have begun to pick up as the weather improves he said To overcome slower sales the home improvement retailer has revved up its strategy to attract pros since they tend to buy larger quantities and offer a steadier source of sales Home Depot has a growing network of distribution centers across the country that can store and deliver roofing shingles insulation and other supplies straight to job sites It announced in late March that it would acquire SRS

Here's how to buy renewable energy from your electric utility,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/21/heres-how-to-buy-renewable-energy-from-your-electric-utility.html,"Tue, 21 May 2024 19:24:17 GMT","More residential consumers are getting their electricity from green energy sources, such as solar and wind.",search.cnbc.com,Wind turbines in Dawson Texas on Feb   Mark Felix  Afp  Getty Images As carbon emissions from fossil fuels keep warming the planet ecoconscious consumers may wonder if theres a way to buy electricity from renewable sources without installing technology like solar panels or windmills on their property In short the answer is yes However the option isnt necessarily available to all homeowners and renters It also often comes with a slight price premium experts said Few people are aware they can buy green energy Renewable energy sources — including wind solar hydropower geothermal and biomass — accounted for about  of US electricity generation in  according to the US Energy Information Administration Most or  of energy sources came from fossil fuels like coal natural gas and oil These energy sources release carbon dioxide a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to global warming The White House aims for electricity generation to be free of greenhouse gas emissions by  watch now A growing number of individuals and organizations are opting to shift away from fossil fuels About  million customers bought  Terawatt hours of renewable energy through voluntary green power markets in  according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory Thats up fivefold from  TWh in  In the voluntary market customers buy renewable energy in amounts that exceed states minimum requirements from utility companies Over half of all US states have policies to raise the share of electricity sourced from renewables though most targets are years away Voluntary purchases accounted for  of the renewable energy market excluding hydropower as of  according to the Environmental Protection Agency They help increase overall demand for renewable electricity thereby driving change in the energy mix the EPA said Photovoltaic solar panels at the Roadrunner solar plant near McCamey Texas on Nov   Jordan VonderhaarBloomberg via Getty Images The bulk of the increase is from corporations according to NREL estimates Residential sales have grown too but more slowly Just one in six US adults know that they may have the option to buy renewable power either from their electric company or another provider according to the most recent NREL survey data on the topic published in  The market does continue to grow every year in terms of sales and customers said Jenny Sumner group manager of modeling and analysis at the NREL But very few people are aware that they can opt into green programs she said Its just not something thats top of mind for most people How consumers can buy green power Joe Raedle  Getty Images News  Getty Images Wind turbines in Solano County California on Aug   Loren ElliottBloomberg via Getty Images Power companies may offer whats known as green pricing programs Customers in these programs also known as utility green power programs pay their utility a small premium to get electricity from renewable sources according to the US Energy Department The cost generally exceeds that of a utilitys standard electricity service by about  to  cents per kilowatt hour Sumner said That may roughly translate to about  to  more per month Sumner said It will ultimately depend on factors like program price and household energy use she added Nearly half of Americans  said they were willing to pay more to get their electricity from  renewable sources according to a  poll by Yale Universitys Program on Climate Change Communication On average they said they would be willing to pay  more per month Green power marketing programs Consumers in some states can also opt into green power marketing programs Such states have competitive energy markets meaning consumers can choose from among many different companies to generate their power But unlike green pricing programs the company generating the renewable power may not be the customers utility which distributes the power According to the US Energy Department and the EPA residential green power options are available in these states with competitive or deregulated markets California Connecticut Delaware Illinois Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan New Hampshire New Jersey New York Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island Texas and Virginia These also tend to come with a premium though in some regions they may be price competitive with default electricity options the agencies wrote Community choice aggregation With community choice aggregation programs local governments buy power from an alternative green power supplier on behalf of their residents The municipality essentially operates as the supplier for the communitys electricity Sumner said These programs are especially prevalent in California she said Unlike the other program types residents generally dont have to opt into community choice programs its typically automatic and consumers can opt out if they wish Sumner said How renewable energy certificates work A solar farm in Imperial California on December   Valerie Macon  Afp  Getty Images Just because a consumer opts for renewable power doesnt mean the electricity being pumped into their home is coming from those renewable sources This may sound strange but it has to do with the physical nature of electricity and its movement through the shared electric grid Once the electrons have been injected into the grid theres no way of tagging that these are green electrons and these are not green said Joydeep Mitra head of the power system program at Michigan State University Nobody knows which electrons are going where watch now Green energy programs instead rely on renewable energy certificates or RECs The certificates are essentially an accounting mechanism for the generation and purchase of renewable energy Mitra said You may not be getting the green power but someone somewhere is And RECs keep track of it all Any consumer even one who doesnt have access to a green power program through their utility can also purchase a REC as a separate standalone product Its a way to provide extra funding to a renewable energy project typically sold by a broker or marketer rather than a utility Sumner said Buying these certificates separately doesnt impact a consumers existing utility service relationship How to

Engage for Good That staying power has franchises hopeful that consumers will continue giving their spare change despite shifts toward online shopping negative economic headwinds and fears that more frequent solicitations will cause fatigue Meanwhile some retailers are fleshing out partnerships first formed after the  racial reckoning pushed corporate citizenship toward the forefront of business practices Studies suggest that asking customers to round up is generally more effective than requesting a fixed amount — even when the totals are the same Thats because the framing lessens the sting of parting with ones money according to a paper published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology It feels less painful said Katie Kelting a Saint Louis University marketing professor who led the research team The timing of the appeal introduces several other psychologically potent factors according to Ike Silver a marketing professor at Northwestern University Buyers tend to perceive their purchases in whole numbers anyway A  bill registers as  for example Plus Silver said it makes the act of giving a bit more mindless Shoppers rushing to get through the checkout line dont have much time to consider reasons against the donation No time to think They capitalize on a purchase inertia where youre just spending your money and youre not really thinking too much about it Silver said Champions of the strategy credit the asks for engaging everyday wouldbe donors in an approachable form of giving with low barriers to entry The practice is so commonplace that shoppers cumulative gifts have even become a key funding stream for some issue areas PetSmart Charities which reports that over  of its cash donations come through the PIN pad at checkout is considered the largest grantmaker for animal welfare causes The pet superstore which has been running its continual PIN pad donation program for  years asks customers to give a fixed dollar amount starting at  The money supports causes directly related to pets such as increased access to veterinary care and animal evacuation services during natural disasters That authentic connection is one reason that PetSmart Charities President Aimee Gilbreath believes their average donation is just under  — which is projected to add up to  million by the end of this year Without the closely aligned missions Gilbreath expects theyd have a slightly harder time getting customers to donate Its just much easier for people to say yes when they get Im here shopping at PetSmart I love pets If I donate to PetSmart Charities Im going to support pets who need a family Im going to support pets in other ways she said Indeed Kelting said the fit between the charity and the seller is huge Customers can perceive pointofsale solicitations as a violation of their social contract with a company according to researchers but partnerships among likeminded organizations are viewed in a more positive light REI Coop a specialty outdoor clothing and equipment seller launched its membersupported public charity in  to help make outdoor spaces more inclusive The goal was to put more resources into the surrounding communities coming out of COVID shutdowns At its  US locations sales associates often strike up personal conversations about buyers upcoming excursions Those unique connections with its clientele of nature enthusiasts open the door for donation requests at checkout according to Squire Simpson a board member at the REI Cooperative Action Fund REI cashiers are supposed to leave the conversation with an openended ask that lets customers decide whether to round up or donate an amount of their choosing About  million from  million individual donations were raised in stores last year according to Simpson a  increase over  Grantees include a Pennsylvania group that promotes biking among Black women and an Alaska nonprofit that provides therapeutic recreation for people with disabilities Its not some broad corporate recipient Simpson said Still some observers are worried that even the best of intentions wont keep the spigot from stopping as likeminded programs pop up in checkout lines around the country Silver the Northwestern University professor questions whether the effectiveness of checkout charity will wane with its popularity If its really something thats coming up every time you swipe your card one risk is people start to notice that and feel a bit more manipulated he said Misinformation does not help either Contrary to popular internet memes tax policy experts say that stores cant write off customers pointofsale donations because they dont count as company income Dominos leaders remain confident in their finetuned strategy With the iconic St Jude child printed on Dominos pizza boxes the established partners are already among the most recognizable when it comes to pointofsale donations Above the checkout widget is a roundup request with that image of the child During its week endoftheyear campaign customers are greeted by a click and go popup soliciting    or  The request details St Judes work and features an overall donation tracker Dominos raised  million last year through roundup Its leadership believes that number will increase under a new fiveyear strategy to grow its customer base Described by CEO Russell Weiner as an audacious goal that isnt necessarily a slam dunk the highdollar charitable commitment adds another motivator to meet its latest nonprofit benchmarks ALSAC CEO Rick Shadyac said the extra Dominos funding will help St Judes efforts in  countries to help triple the survival rate for children with the six most common forms of childhood cancer That includes this summers rollout of a program that will eventually provide free

late motherinlaws estate into a fortune estimated at more than  million hurtling him into the ranks of Forbes magazines list of the  richest Americans Once implicated in insider trading Boesky cooperated with a brash young US attorney named Rudolph Giuliani in a bid for leniency uncovering a scandal that shattered promising careers blemished some of the most respected US investment brokerages and injected a certain paranoia into the securities industry Working undercover Boesky secretly taped three conversations with Michael Milken the socalled junk bond king whose work with Drexel Burnham Lambert had revolutionized the credit markets Milken eventually pleaded guilty to six felonies and served  months in prison while Boesky paid a  million fine and spent  months in a minimumsecurity California prison nicknamed Club Fed beginning in March  Linked to Gordon Gekko After Boeskys arrest accounts circulated widely that he had had told business students during a commencement address at the University of California at Berkeley in  or  Greed is all right by the way I want you to know that I think greed is healthy You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself The line was memorably echoed by Michael Douglas in his Oscarwinning portrayal of Gordon Gekko a highflying trader in Oliver Stones  film Wall Street The point is ladies and gentlemen that greed for lack of a better word is good Douglas tells the shareholders of Teldar Paper Greed is right Greed works Greed clarifies cuts through and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit Boesky however said he couldnt remember saying greed is healthy and denied another quotation attributed to him in the  Atlantic Monthly in which he allegedly said that climbing to the height of a huge pile of silver dollars would be an aphrodisiac experience While he usually worked hour days the silverhaired and lean Boesky also lived a life of opulence He wore designer clothes traveled in

statutes Levine revealed everything and Boesky began talking as well providing information leading to convictions or guilty pleas in cases involving former stockbroker Boyd Jefferies Siegel four executives of Britians Guiness PLC takeover strategist Paul Bilzerian stock speculator Salim Lewis and others The most notable arrest was of Milken the pioneering financier who had transformed capital markets in the s with a new form of bond that allowed thousands of midsized companies to raise money In the s those junk bonds were used to finance thousands of leveraged buyouts including Revlon Beatrice Companies RJR Nabisco Inc and Federated Department Stores making Milken a hated and feared figure on Wall Street The financier and philanthropist was indicted on  counts including securities

own ambition his own greed The jury convicted Mulheren but his conviction was later overturned Other convictions were reversed as well — those of GAF Corp and a senior executive five principals of PrincetonNewport Partners and that of a former Drexel trader The reversals bolstered the arguments of freetraders who argued that Wall Street had been victimized by a publicityseeking federal prosecutor using racketeering statutes usually reserved to combat organized crime The government had previously done little to police insider trading and some said it should be legalized But no one could defend payoffs involving suitcases full of cash Levine writing in the pages of Fortune after his release said he couldnt understand why Boesky would risk so much by engaging in something so clearly illegal And I dont know why Ivan engaged in illegal activities when he had a fortune estimated at over  million Levine wrote in  Im sure he derived much of his wealth from legitimate enterprise He was skilled at arbitrage and obsessed with his work He must have been driven by something beyond rational behavior At his  sentencing Boeskys lawyer quoted his psychiatrist as saying

The high price of popular diabetes drugs prevents many people from getting them.",www.cbsnews.com,For the past year and a half Tandra Cooper Harris and her husband Marcus who both have diabetes have struggled to fill their prescriptions for the medications they need to control their blood sugar Without Ozempic or a similar drug Cooper Harris suffers blackouts becomes too tired to watch her grandchildren and struggles to earn extra money braiding hair Marcus Harris who works as a Waffle House cook needs Trulicity to keep his legs and feet from swelling and bruising The couples doctor has tried prescribing similar drugs which mimic a hormone that suppresses appetite and controls blood sugar by boosting insulin production But those too are often out of stock Other times their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace burdens the couple with a lengthy approval process or an outofpocket cost they cant afford Its like Im having to jump through hoops to live said Cooper Harris  a resident of Covington Georgia east of Atlanta Supply shortages and insurance hurdles for this powerful class of drugs called GLP agonists have left many people who are suffering from diabetes and obesity without the medicines they need to stay healthy One root of the problem is the very high prices set by drugmakers About  of adults who had taken a GLP drug including those with insurance said the cost was difficult to afford according to KFF poll results released this month But it is patients with the lowest disposable incomes who are being hit the hardest These are people with few resources who struggle to see doctors and buy healthy foods In the United States Novo Nordisk charges about  for a months supply of Ozempic and Eli Lilly charges a similar amount for Mounjaro Prices for a months supply of different GLP drugs range from  to  before insurance coverage according to the PetersonKFF Health System Tracker Medicare spending for three popular diabetes and weight loss drugs — Ozempic Rybelsus and Mounjaro — reached  billion in  up from  million in  according to research by KFF The outrageously high price has the potential to bankrupt Medicare Medicaid and our entire health care system Sen Bernie Sanders an independent from Vermont who chairs the US Senate Committee on Health Education Labor and Pensions wrote in a letter to Novo Nordisk in April The high prices also mean that not everyone who needs the drugs can get them Theyre kind of disadvantaged in multiple ways already and this is just one more way said Wedad Rahman an endocrinologist with Piedmont Healthcare in Conyers Georgia Many of Rahmans patients including Cooper Harris are underserved have highdeductible health plans or are on public assistance programs like Medicaid or Medicare Many drugmakers have programs that help patients get started and stay on medicines for little or no cost But those programs have not been reliable for medicines like Ozempic and Trulicity because of the supply shortages And many insurers requirements that patients receive prior authorization or first try less expensive drugs add to delays in care By the time many of Rahmans patients see her their diabetes has gone unmanaged for years and theyre suffering from severe complications like foot wounds or blindness And thats the end of the road Rahman said I have to pick something else thats more affordable and isnt as good for them GLP agonists — the category of drugs that includes Ozempic Trulicity and Mounjaro — were first approved to treat diabetes In the last three years the Food and Drug Administration has approved rebranded versions of Mounjaro and Ozempic for weight loss leading demand to skyrocket And demand is only growing as more of the drugs benefits become apparent In March the FDA approved the weight loss drug Wegovy a version of Ozempic to treat heart problems which will likely increase demand and spending Up to  million Americans or  of the US population are expected to be on a GLP agonist by  the financial services company JP Morgan estimated As more patients try to get prescriptions for GLP agonists drugmakers struggle to make enough doses Eli Lilly is urging people to avoid using its drug Mounjaro for cosmetic weight loss to ensure enough supplies for people with medical conditions But the drugs popularity continues to grow despite side effects such as nausea and constipation driven by their effectiveness and celebrity endorsements In March Oprah Winfrey released an hourlong special on the medicines ability to help with weight loss It can seem like everyone in the world is taking this class of medication said Jody Dushay an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an endocrinologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center But its kind of not as many people as you think she said There just isnt any Even when the drugs are in stock insurers are clamping down leaving patients and health care providers to navigate a thicket of everchanging coverage rules State Medicaid plans vary in their coverage of the drugs for weight loss Medicare wont cover the drugs if they are prescribed for obesity And commercial insurers are tightening access due to the drugs cost Health care providers are cobbling together care plans based on whats available and what patients can afford For example Cooper Harris insurer covers Trulicity but not Ozempic which she said she prefers because it has fewer side effects When her pharmacy was out of Trulicity she had to rely more on insulin instead of switching to Ozempic Rahman said One day in March Brandi Addison an endocrinologist in Corpus Christi Texas had to adjust the prescriptions for all  of the patients she saw because of issues with drug availability and cost she said One patient insured through a teacher retirement health plan with a high deductible couldnt afford to be on a GLP agonist Addison said Until she reaches that deductible thats just not a medication she can use Addison said Instead she put her patient on insulin whose price is capped at a fraction of the cost of Ozempic but which doesnt have the same benefits Those patients who have a fixed income are going to be our more vulnerable patients Addison said KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces indepth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating
